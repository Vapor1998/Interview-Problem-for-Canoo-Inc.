Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Investing > Stock Market > Market Sectors > Consumer Discretionary > Automotive Stocks > Auto Parts Stocks Investing in Auto Parts & OEM Stocks By Lee Samaha – Updated Nov 9, 2023 at 4:17PM Source: Getty Images Auto parts stocks offer something for every type of investor -- whether you’re an aggressive investor looking to invest in blue-sky technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) and driverless cars, or a risk-averse investor worried about a recession. With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

Investing in Metal Stocks A closer look at this subgroup of the basic materials sector and some of the best metals stocks to invest in. A sector to invest in?The auto parts industry offers something for every investor, ranging from high risk/high reward types of technology plays, through balanced risk options such as Gentex or BorgWarner, all the way to recession-resistant options such as auto parts retailers. If you have a specific risk preference and/or a strong belief in where the automotive industry is headed, there will be an exciting stock to invest in on this list. If you’re investing in OEM parts stocks, just remember to keep an eye on industry forecasts for LPV and how auto suppliers are planning to increase CPV. For the aftermarket, the key is to follow miles driven and how a company competes within its end markets. Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Investing > Stock Market > Market Sectors > Consumer Discretionary > Automotive Stocks > Auto Parts Stocks Investing in Auto Parts & OEM Stocks By Lee Samaha – Updated Nov 9, 2023 at 4:17PM Source: Getty Images Auto parts stocks offer something for every type of investor -- whether you’re an aggressive investor looking to invest in blue-sky technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) and driverless cars, or a risk-averse investor worried about a recession. With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

Investing in Metal Stocks A closer look at this subgroup of the basic materials sector and some of the best metals stocks to invest in. A sector to invest in?The auto parts industry offers something for every investor, ranging from high risk/high reward types of technology plays, through balanced risk options such as Gentex or BorgWarner, all the way to recession-resistant options such as auto parts retailers. If you have a specific risk preference and/or a strong belief in where the automotive industry is headed, there will be an exciting stock to invest in on this list. If you’re investing in OEM parts stocks, just remember to keep an eye on industry forecasts for LPV and how auto suppliers are planning to increase CPV. For the aftermarket, the key is to follow miles driven and how a company competes within its end markets. Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Zacks Equity Research for                                       Zacks -> The auto retail industry is on a roll, thanks to increasing demand for vehicles amid preference for private transportation and economic growth. Thanks to unprecedented fiscal stimulus and stepped-up vaccination drive, the economy is soaring and consumer spending is on the rise, with Americans being way more confident to make discretionary purchases. U.S. auto sales continued to gather steam in second-quarter 2021, thanks to easier credit conditions, bullish consumer sentiment, soaring popularity of electric vehicles and rapid digitization. With millions of Americans now fully vaccinated, more people are expected to go out and the momentum in vehicle demand is likely to continue. While the average prices of cars are on the rise amid chip crunch, demand is still accelerating, which is likely to result in higher profits for retailers. Amid the rosy prospects of the industry, O'Reilly Automotive ORLY appears to be an interesting choice for investors. O’Reilly’s revenue growth is impressive. The specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts has been generating record revenues for 28 consecutive years on the back of stable growth in the auto parts market and expansion of the store base. In addition to opening stores in new markets, the company has been actively increasing store count in less-populated areas. It opened 68 new stores during first-quarter 2021, bringing the total store count to 5,682 as of Mar 31, 2021. O'Reilly’s penetration in new and contiguous markets will help in business growth in markets across the country. The firm’s buyout of Mayasa Auto Parts bodes well and marks O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction.The company has a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy and a strong distribution network. O’Reilly’s wide-ranging product portfolio caters to DIY (“Do-It-Yourself”) and DIFM (“Do-it-for-Me”) customers, which are driving comparable store sales growth. The company delivered exceptional comps sales growth and EBIT performance in the last reported quarter due to robust demand for DIY-based projects, market share gains as well as elimination of maintenance deferrals. Moreover, growing demand for technologically advanced auto parts is likely to drive O’Reilly’s prospects. Increased complexity of auto parts and repairs is driving more people to independent repair shops. Thus, as cars as getting more technologically advanced, high-quality auto parts are much in demand, which are likely to bolster O’Reilly’s sales and earnings in the future.Year to date, the stock have increased 28.5%, surpassing the industry and S&P 500’s growth of 21.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The company has significantly outperformed the auto sector, which has lost 1.8% during the same time period.Year-to-Date PerformanceImage Source: Zacks Investment Research O’Reilly — which shares space with Advance Auto parts AAP, AutoZone AZO and CarMax KMX — currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

O'Reilly (ORLY)    July 09, 2021 — 10:56 am EDT       Written by                         Zacks Equity Research for                                       Zacks -> The auto retail industry is on a roll, thanks to increasing demand for vehicles amid preference for private transportation and economic growth. Thanks to unprecedented fiscal stimulus and stepped-up vaccination drive, the economy is soaring and consumer spending is on the rise, with Americans being way more confident to make discretionary purchases. U.S. auto sales continued to gather steam in second-quarter 2021, thanks to easier credit conditions, bullish consumer sentiment, soaring popularity of electric vehicles and rapid digitization. With millions of Americans now fully vaccinated, more people are expected to go out and the momentum in vehicle demand is likely to continue. While the average prices of cars are on the rise amid chip crunch, demand is still accelerating, which is likely to result in higher profits for retailers. Amid the rosy prospects of the industry, O'Reilly Automotive ORLY appears to be an interesting choice for investors. O’Reilly’s revenue growth is impressive. The specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts has been generating record revenues for 28 consecutive years on the back of stable growth in the auto parts market and expansion of the store base. In addition to opening stores in new markets, the company has been actively increasing store count in less-populated areas. It opened 68 new stores during first-quarter 2021, bringing the total store count to 5,682 as of Mar 31, 2021. O'Reilly’s penetration in new and contiguous markets will help in business growth in markets across the country. The firm’s buyout of Mayasa Auto Parts bodes well and marks O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction.The company has a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy and a strong distribution network. O’Reilly’s wide-ranging product portfolio caters to DIY (“Do-It-Yourself”) and DIFM (“Do-it-for-Me”) customers, which are driving comparable store sales growth. The company delivered exceptional comps sales growth and EBIT performance in the last reported quarter due to robust demand for DIY-based projects, market share gains as well as elimination of maintenance deferrals. Moreover, growing demand for technologically advanced auto parts is likely to drive O’Reilly’s prospects. Increased complexity of auto parts and repairs is driving more people to independent repair shops. Thus, as cars as getting more technologically advanced, high-quality auto parts are much in demand, which are likely to bolster O’Reilly’s sales and earnings in the future.Year to date, the stock have increased 28.5%, surpassing the industry and S&P 500’s growth of 21.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The company has significantly outperformed the auto sector, which has lost 1.8% during the same time period.Year-to-Date PerformanceImage Source: Zacks Investment Research O’Reilly — which shares space with Advance Auto parts AAP, AutoZone AZO and CarMax KMX — currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

O'Reilly (ORLY)    July 09, 2021 — 10:56 am EDT       Written by                         Zacks Equity Research for                                       Zacks -> The auto retail industry is on a roll, thanks to increasing demand for vehicles amid preference for private transportation and economic growth. Thanks to unprecedented fiscal stimulus and stepped-up vaccination drive, the economy is soaring and consumer spending is on the rise, with Americans being way more confident to make discretionary purchases. U.S. auto sales continued to gather steam in second-quarter 2021, thanks to easier credit conditions, bullish consumer sentiment, soaring popularity of electric vehicles and rapid digitization. With millions of Americans now fully vaccinated, more people are expected to go out and the momentum in vehicle demand is likely to continue. While the average prices of cars are on the rise amid chip crunch, demand is still accelerating, which is likely to result in higher profits for retailers. Amid the rosy prospects of the industry, O'Reilly Automotive ORLY appears to be an interesting choice for investors. O’Reilly’s revenue growth is impressive. The specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts has been generating record revenues for 28 consecutive years on the back of stable growth in the auto parts market and expansion of the store base. In addition to opening stores in new markets, the company has been actively increasing store count in less-populated areas. It opened 68 new stores during first-quarter 2021, bringing the total store count to 5,682 as of Mar 31, 2021. O'Reilly’s penetration in new and contiguous markets will help in business growth in markets across the country. The firm’s buyout of Mayasa Auto Parts bodes well and marks O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction.The company has a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy and a strong distribution network. O’Reilly’s wide-ranging product portfolio caters to DIY (“Do-It-Yourself”) and DIFM (“Do-it-for-Me”) customers, which are driving comparable store sales growth. The company delivered exceptional comps sales growth and EBIT performance in the last reported quarter due to robust demand for DIY-based projects, market share gains as well as elimination of maintenance deferrals. Moreover, growing demand for technologically advanced auto parts is likely to drive O’Reilly’s prospects. Increased complexity of auto parts and repairs is driving more people to independent repair shops. Thus, as cars as getting more technologically advanced, high-quality auto parts are much in demand, which are likely to bolster O’Reilly’s sales and earnings in the future.Year to date, the stock have increased 28.5%, surpassing the industry and S&P 500’s growth of 21.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The company has significantly outperformed the auto sector, which has lost 1.8% during the same time period.Year-to-Date PerformanceImage Source: Zacks Investment Research O’Reilly — which shares space with Advance Auto parts AAP, AutoZone AZO and CarMax KMX — currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Investing > Stock Market > Market Sectors > Consumer Discretionary > Automotive Stocks > Auto Parts Stocks Investing in Auto Parts & OEM Stocks By Lee Samaha – Updated Nov 9, 2023 at 4:17PM Source: Getty Images Auto parts stocks offer something for every type of investor -- whether you’re an aggressive investor looking to invest in blue-sky technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) and driverless cars, or a risk-averse investor worried about a recession. With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Investing > Stock Market > Market Sectors > Consumer Discretionary > Automotive Stocks > Auto Parts Stocks Investing in Auto Parts & OEM Stocks By Lee Samaha – Updated Nov 9, 2023 at 4:17PM Source: Getty Images Auto parts stocks offer something for every type of investor -- whether you’re an aggressive investor looking to invest in blue-sky technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) and driverless cars, or a risk-averse investor worried about a recession. With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option.

The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

It is expected to reach USD 20 billion in the next five years, registering a CAGR of around 2% during the forecast period. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US aftermarket automotive market was severe, and this can be attributed to several productions halts in the manufacturing industry due to lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed by governments across the world. The supply chain of the entire automotive industry is disrupted, impacting the production of automotive parts and components in the market. However, the market is expected to have steady growth as demand for auto parts manufacturing is directly related to the performance of automakers, as they are the largest purchasers of industry products. The advantages of original replacement parts are one of the primary factors driving the growth of the automotive parts aftermarket in the US. The increasing availability of automotive parts on e-commerce platforms is one of the major aftermarket trends in the United States. The emergence of 3D printing in the automotive aftermarket industry and the growing demand for hybrid and all-electric vehicles are likely to further boost the market growth during the forecast period. Furthermore, the rise in the sales of used cars is likely to create numerous opportunities for the key players operating in the US aftermarket automotive parts and components market. USA Aftermarket Automotive Parts & Components Market Trends  This section covers the major market trends shaping the US Aftermarket Automotive Parts & Components Market according to our research experts:  Rising Online Aftermarket Automotive Parts and Components Sales The US aftermarket automotive parts and components market is projected to have optimistic growth due to increased online activities by people. Advancement in technology, coupled with rapid improvement in logistics, has allowed manufacturers to offer high-quality goods faster and further boosts the growth of the market. E-commerce activities grow at a higher rate than the forecast rate due to the ongoing pandemic. Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, the automotive aftermarket once again demonstrated its resilience in 2020 with a greater-than-anticipated performance. The industry rebounded strongly in 2021. It is estimated that the overall light-duty vehicle aftermarket sales in the United States will rise around 11.2% to USD 325 billion in 2021. In general, the growth rate of online parts sales has historically been about 16% per year, but in 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic, e-Commerce activities surged to a 30% increase. This includes replacement parts, aftermarket parts, and accessories. Thus, this pandemic has created lucrative opportunities for the major players in the market during the forecast period. Automotive parts and components online shopping is growing. As automotive technology is changing, more hybrids and electric vehicles are entering the market, boosting the growth of the US aftermarket automotive parts and components market. In addition, mobile shopping is on the rise, and online platforms like Amazon and eBay are likely to influence the US online aftermarket automotive parts and components market. Understand The Key Trends Shaping This Market Download PDF Increasing Electric Vehicle Sales Likely to Impact Market The market for electric vehicles is increasing year on year, impacting the growth of the automotive industry. The annual sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the United States crossed 172.1 thousand units in 2021, indicating the high demand for parts and components to cater to the needs of this market. In addition, the United States is the largest manufacturer of plug-in hybrid vehicles in the North American region. The country is also the largest market for these vehicles, with manufacturers such as Cadillac, GMC, Tesla, and Chrysler, leading the market. With the automobile industry's continuous shift towards e-mobility, the sale of plug-in electric vehicles has been increasing in the United States for the past few years. While conventional powertrain vehicles have more than 2,000 components within them, electric vehicles have far fewer. For instance, Tesla revealed that in its drivetrain, there are only 17 moving parts, including two in the motor. Since the drivetrain is the heart of any electric vehicle, it is expected that automotive component manufacturers will first start with their associated part manufacturing. Also, it is estimated that out of the 590,000 U.S. employees engaged in auto parts manufacturing, nearly 150,000 are in component manufacturing for Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). This number is expected to change over the forecast period as companies will dedicate some of them toward EV parts and component production. Power Inverters, DC-DC Converters, Battery & related parts, and Motor Control Units (MCU) are some of the other important parts that will also be manufactured by companies over time to stay relevant in the market. The adoption of EV-related spare parts will be slow in the after-market space initially, but with the industry seeing a paradigm shift, the rate is expected to grow considerably after some years. USA Aftermarket Automotive Parts & Components Industry Overview The US aftermarket automotive parts and components market is neither consolidated nor fragmented due to the presence of major tier-1 and tier-2 component manufacturers and a large number of unorganized players in the market. Companies are focusing on marketing their products and tying up with local dealers to garner more market share. Some of the major players in the market include Magna International Inc., Continental AG, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, DENSO Corporation, and Lear Corporation. Players are partnering with other key players to gain market share. For instance, in March 2022, Meritor, Inc. announced a collaboration agreement with ConMet under which Meritor will develop custom trailer suspensions and brakes, as well as tire inflation systems, to work with ConMet's PreSet Plus eHub to enable the production of zero-emissions refrigerated trailers. Meritor is redesigning its trailer suspension and drum brake, as well as a specially engineered spindle package to be compatible with ConMet's eHub, to deliver this electrified trailer solution. The companies will also continue to evaluate the application of complementary advanced technologies that address evolving e-mobility market trends in collaboration.

E-commerce activities grow at a higher rate than the forecast rate due to the ongoing pandemic. Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, the automotive aftermarket once again demonstrated its resilience in 2020 with a greater-than-anticipated performance. The industry rebounded strongly in 2021. It is estimated that the overall light-duty vehicle aftermarket sales in the United States will rise around 11.2% to USD 325 billion in 2021. In general, the growth rate of online parts sales has historically been about 16% per year, but in 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic, e-Commerce activities surged to a 30% increase. This includes replacement parts, aftermarket parts, and accessories. Thus, this pandemic has created lucrative opportunities for the major players in the market during the forecast period. Automotive parts and components online shopping is growing. As automotive technology is changing, more hybrids and electric vehicles are entering the market, boosting the growth of the US aftermarket automotive parts and components market. In addition, mobile shopping is on the rise, and online platforms like Amazon and eBay are likely to influence the US online aftermarket automotive parts and components market. Understand The Key Trends Shaping This Market Download PDF Increasing Electric Vehicle Sales Likely to Impact Market The market for electric vehicles is increasing year on year, impacting the growth of the automotive industry. The annual sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the United States crossed 172.1 thousand units in 2021, indicating the high demand for parts and components to cater to the needs of this market. In addition, the United States is the largest manufacturer of plug-in hybrid vehicles in the North American region. The country is also the largest market for these vehicles, with manufacturers such as Cadillac, GMC, Tesla, and Chrysler, leading the market. With the automobile industry's continuous shift towards e-mobility, the sale of plug-in electric vehicles has been increasing in the United States for the past few years. While conventional powertrain vehicles have more than 2,000 components within them, electric vehicles have far fewer. For instance, Tesla revealed that in its drivetrain, there are only 17 moving parts, including two in the motor. Since the drivetrain is the heart of any electric vehicle, it is expected that automotive component manufacturers will first start with their associated part manufacturing. Also, it is estimated that out of the 590,000 U.S. employees engaged in auto parts manufacturing, nearly 150,000 are in component manufacturing for Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). This number is expected to change over the forecast period as companies will dedicate some of them toward EV parts and component production. Power Inverters, DC-DC Converters, Battery & related parts, and Motor Control Units (MCU) are some of the other important parts that will also be manufactured by companies over time to stay relevant in the market. The adoption of EV-related spare parts will be slow in the after-market space initially, but with the industry seeing a paradigm shift, the rate is expected to grow considerably after some years. USA Aftermarket Automotive Parts & Components Industry Overview The US aftermarket automotive parts and components market is neither consolidated nor fragmented due to the presence of major tier-1 and tier-2 component manufacturers and a large number of unorganized players in the market. Companies are focusing on marketing their products and tying up with local dealers to garner more market share.

Meritor is redesigning its trailer suspension and drum brake, as well as a specially engineered spindle package to be compatible with ConMet's eHub, to deliver this electrified trailer solution. The companies will also continue to evaluate the application of complementary advanced technologies that address evolving e-mobility market trends in collaboration.

Singhi for                                       Zacks ->                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Robust pent-up demand for vehicles, coupled with improved inventory levels, is bolstering the outlook for the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry. The introduction of sophisticated and high-tech vehicles has driven consumers toward professional assistance, creating fresh avenues for industry participants. In adapting to the evolving market landscape, the auto retail parts sector must chart a comprehensive roadmap to maximize these opportunities. Companies such as O’Reilly Automotive ORLY and AutoZone AZO are poised to navigate and thrive in this dynamic industry environment.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry players execute several functions. These include manufacturing, retailing, distribution and installation of vehicle parts, equipment and accessories. Vehicle parts and accessories include seat covers, antifreeze, engine additives, wiper blades, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps. Consumers have two options. They can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own (the “do-it-yourself” or DIY segment) or take the assistance of a professional repair facility (the “do-it-for me” or DIFM segment). The industry is highly competitive and undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers. Factors at PlaySoaring Vehicle Sales to Rev Up Auto Parts Demand: Per Cox Automotive, U.S. new vehicle sales in 2023 are projected to increase 10% year over year, marking the highest levels since 2019, driven by heightened pent-up demand for personal mobility, improved inventory levels and the introduction of appealing vehicle models. Auto parts retailers stand to benefit as the upswing in new vehicle demand correlates with an increased need for parts and accessories. As vehicle sales increase, the demand for both retail and wholesale auto parts experiences a concurrent rise, providing a positive outlook for industry participants. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain a stable interest rate and the anticipation of future cuts in 2024 enhance the industry landscape, fostering a lower cost of vehicle financing and bolstering the auto parts sector.Technology Progress and Digitization to Propel Growth: The ongoing transformation in the auto retail parts industry, fueled by changing customer preferences and technological advancements, presents a promising landscape for growth. The shift toward sophisticated vehicles has elevated the demand for professional assistance. Extensive digitization and the implementation of omnichannel marketing strategies are reshaping the industry fundamentally. This change benefits auto retail parts because it aligns with the industry's move toward modernization. With consumers increasingly relying on professional services and the seamless integration of technology, the industry is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and is primed for sales growth.Cost Headwinds Remain: Although inflation is cooling down, it is still way above the Fed’s target. The combination of an inflationary environment and supply chain constraints is driving up operational costs, impacting profit margins. Rising expenses, exacerbated by distribution inefficiencies, labor difficulties and global logistics issues, are putting pressure on industry players.Also, the shift toward complex vehicles is resulting in higher capex and R&D costs. The adoption of omnichannel marketing and digitalization is driving up operational costs, potentially curbing profit margins. The industry must strategically outline a comprehensive plan to capitalize on these opportunities amid a shifting market landscape. Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Auto Retail & Wholesale Parts industry is within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92, which places it in the top 37% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The industry has gained 3.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500 and the sector’s growth of 16.7% and 16.8%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.

14, 2023 — 08:19 am EST       Written by                         Rimmi Singhi for                                       Zacks ->                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Robust pent-up demand for vehicles, coupled with improved inventory levels, is bolstering the outlook for the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry. The introduction of sophisticated and high-tech vehicles has driven consumers toward professional assistance, creating fresh avenues for industry participants. In adapting to the evolving market landscape, the auto retail parts sector must chart a comprehensive roadmap to maximize these opportunities. Companies such as O’Reilly Automotive ORLY and AutoZone AZO are poised to navigate and thrive in this dynamic industry environment.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry players execute several functions. These include manufacturing, retailing, distribution and installation of vehicle parts, equipment and accessories. Vehicle parts and accessories include seat covers, antifreeze, engine additives, wiper blades, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps. Consumers have two options. They can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own (the “do-it-yourself” or DIY segment) or take the assistance of a professional repair facility (the “do-it-for me” or DIFM segment). The industry is highly competitive and undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers. Factors at PlaySoaring Vehicle Sales to Rev Up Auto Parts Demand: Per Cox Automotive, U.S. new vehicle sales in 2023 are projected to increase 10% year over year, marking the highest levels since 2019, driven by heightened pent-up demand for personal mobility, improved inventory levels and the introduction of appealing vehicle models. Auto parts retailers stand to benefit as the upswing in new vehicle demand correlates with an increased need for parts and accessories. As vehicle sales increase, the demand for both retail and wholesale auto parts experiences a concurrent rise, providing a positive outlook for industry participants. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain a stable interest rate and the anticipation of future cuts in 2024 enhance the industry landscape, fostering a lower cost of vehicle financing and bolstering the auto parts sector.Technology Progress and Digitization to Propel Growth: The ongoing transformation in the auto retail parts industry, fueled by changing customer preferences and technological advancements, presents a promising landscape for growth. The shift toward sophisticated vehicles has elevated the demand for professional assistance. Extensive digitization and the implementation of omnichannel marketing strategies are reshaping the industry fundamentally. This change benefits auto retail parts because it aligns with the industry's move toward modernization. With consumers increasingly relying on professional services and the seamless integration of technology, the industry is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and is primed for sales growth.Cost Headwinds Remain: Although inflation is cooling down, it is still way above the Fed’s target. The combination of an inflationary environment and supply chain constraints is driving up operational costs, impacting profit margins. Rising expenses, exacerbated by distribution inefficiencies, labor difficulties and global logistics issues, are putting pressure on industry players.Also, the shift toward complex vehicles is resulting in higher capex and R&D costs. The adoption of omnichannel marketing and digitalization is driving up operational costs, potentially curbing profit margins. The industry must strategically outline a comprehensive plan to capitalize on these opportunities amid a shifting market landscape. Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Auto Retail & Wholesale Parts industry is within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector.

14, 2023 — 08:19 am EST       Written by                         Rimmi Singhi for                                       Zacks ->                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Robust pent-up demand for vehicles, coupled with improved inventory levels, is bolstering the outlook for the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry. The introduction of sophisticated and high-tech vehicles has driven consumers toward professional assistance, creating fresh avenues for industry participants. In adapting to the evolving market landscape, the auto retail parts sector must chart a comprehensive roadmap to maximize these opportunities. Companies such as O’Reilly Automotive ORLY and AutoZone AZO are poised to navigate and thrive in this dynamic industry environment.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry players execute several functions. These include manufacturing, retailing, distribution and installation of vehicle parts, equipment and accessories. Vehicle parts and accessories include seat covers, antifreeze, engine additives, wiper blades, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps. Consumers have two options. They can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own (the “do-it-yourself” or DIY segment) or take the assistance of a professional repair facility (the “do-it-for me” or DIFM segment). The industry is highly competitive and undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers. Factors at PlaySoaring Vehicle Sales to Rev Up Auto Parts Demand: Per Cox Automotive, U.S. new vehicle sales in 2023 are projected to increase 10% year over year, marking the highest levels since 2019, driven by heightened pent-up demand for personal mobility, improved inventory levels and the introduction of appealing vehicle models. Auto parts retailers stand to benefit as the upswing in new vehicle demand correlates with an increased need for parts and accessories. As vehicle sales increase, the demand for both retail and wholesale auto parts experiences a concurrent rise, providing a positive outlook for industry participants. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain a stable interest rate and the anticipation of future cuts in 2024 enhance the industry landscape, fostering a lower cost of vehicle financing and bolstering the auto parts sector.Technology Progress and Digitization to Propel Growth: The ongoing transformation in the auto retail parts industry, fueled by changing customer preferences and technological advancements, presents a promising landscape for growth. The shift toward sophisticated vehicles has elevated the demand for professional assistance. Extensive digitization and the implementation of omnichannel marketing strategies are reshaping the industry fundamentally. This change benefits auto retail parts because it aligns with the industry's move toward modernization. With consumers increasingly relying on professional services and the seamless integration of technology, the industry is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and is primed for sales growth.Cost Headwinds Remain: Although inflation is cooling down, it is still way above the Fed’s target. The combination of an inflationary environment and supply chain constraints is driving up operational costs, impacting profit margins. Rising expenses, exacerbated by distribution inefficiencies, labor difficulties and global logistics issues, are putting pressure on industry players.Also, the shift toward complex vehicles is resulting in higher capex and R&D costs. The adoption of omnichannel marketing and digitalization is driving up operational costs, potentially curbing profit margins. The industry must strategically outline a comprehensive plan to capitalize on these opportunities amid a shifting market landscape. Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Auto Retail & Wholesale Parts industry is within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

03, 2022 — 02:06 pm EDT       Written by                         Michelle Jones for                                       ValueWalk -> In 2021, one of the big stories for consumers was the global shortage of chips used in new vehicles. While the news may have died down a bit this year, the problem certainly hasn't gone away. In fact, auto industry experts told Automotive News Canada toward the end of June that the shortage of new vehicles is likely to last ""well into next year, if not 2024.""Q2 2022 hedge fund letters, conferences and more   Two Trends That Support The Thesis For Auto Part StocksThe issue has resulted in two trends, both of which support the thesis that auto parts stocks may be good buys right now. The first is that the prices for both new and used cars have skyrocketed over the last year. In June, Fortune reported that new vehicle prices had risen 12.6% year over year, while prices for used cars and trucks were up 16% since last year.The other trend has resulted from that first trend. The higher vehicle prices are causing drivers to keep their cars for significantly longer than they otherwise would. As a result, the need for repairs and auto parts is much higher than it would be otherwise.Further, the increasing likelihood of a recession will increase this need even more, making auto parts retailers a recession-resistant industry. After all, people in most suburban and rural markets still need to keep their vehicles in good working order so that they can get to work. Additionally, the average age of a vehicle on U.S. roads right now is about 12 years, a record high.Some Of The Biggest Names In The SpaceInvestors need only look around their neighborhood for the names of some of the largest brick-and-mortar auto parts retailers. Of course, while some of these companies may be particularly attractive buys, they aren't all created equal. Some of the retailers with the largest footprints include Autozone Inc (NYSE:AZO) and O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive shares are up 2% year to date and 10% over the last month, with half of that gain coming in the last five trading days. Unfortunately, the company missed the consensus estimate for its second-quarter earnings per share, coming in at $8.78 per share and $3.7 billion in revenue, compared to the expected $8.99 per share. However, analysts have had plenty of good things to say about it. One of the best things about AutoZone is its $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The company's stock is up 5% year to date, including about 1% over the last five trading days. AutoZone also posted strong beats against the consensus estimates for its third fiscal quarter. The retailer reported $29.03 per share in earnings on $3.9 billion in revenue, compared to the consensus numbers of $26.21 per share and $3.7 billion.Don't Forget E-Commerce RetailersDespite the strength of the above brick-and-mortar auto parts retailers, another company that shouldn't be dismissed is Carparts.com Inc (NASDAQ:PRTS), an online retailer of auto partners in the U.S. Given consumers' propensity for shopping online, an online retailer should be a strong option.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksMitsubishi ElectricDriving mobilityMitsubishi ElectricLearn MoreUndo However, Carparts.com shares are down 23% year to date, even after the 28.5% rally over the last month, of which 15% has come during the last five trading days. The company did beat consensus estimates for the second quarter, posting earnings of 7 cents per share on $176.2 million in revenue. Analysts had been expecting losses of 3 cents per share on $175.8 million in revenue.Overall, the auto parts sector looks robust due to current secular trends, so retailers would do well to check out the above names to see whether they might fit in their portfolio.

Attractive, And Here Are Three Potential Picks    August 03, 2022 — 02:06 pm EDT       Written by                         Michelle Jones for                                       ValueWalk -> In 2021, one of the big stories for consumers was the global shortage of chips used in new vehicles. While the news may have died down a bit this year, the problem certainly hasn't gone away. In fact, auto industry experts told Automotive News Canada toward the end of June that the shortage of new vehicles is likely to last ""well into next year, if not 2024.""Q2 2022 hedge fund letters, conferences and more   Two Trends That Support The Thesis For Auto Part StocksThe issue has resulted in two trends, both of which support the thesis that auto parts stocks may be good buys right now. The first is that the prices for both new and used cars have skyrocketed over the last year. In June, Fortune reported that new vehicle prices had risen 12.6% year over year, while prices for used cars and trucks were up 16% since last year.The other trend has resulted from that first trend. The higher vehicle prices are causing drivers to keep their cars for significantly longer than they otherwise would. As a result, the need for repairs and auto parts is much higher than it would be otherwise.Further, the increasing likelihood of a recession will increase this need even more, making auto parts retailers a recession-resistant industry. After all, people in most suburban and rural markets still need to keep their vehicles in good working order so that they can get to work. Additionally, the average age of a vehicle on U.S. roads right now is about 12 years, a record high.Some Of The Biggest Names In The SpaceInvestors need only look around their neighborhood for the names of some of the largest brick-and-mortar auto parts retailers. Of course, while some of these companies may be particularly attractive buys, they aren't all created equal. Some of the retailers with the largest footprints include Autozone Inc (NYSE:AZO) and O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive shares are up 2% year to date and 10% over the last month, with half of that gain coming in the last five trading days. Unfortunately, the company missed the consensus estimate for its second-quarter earnings per share, coming in at $8.78 per share and $3.7 billion in revenue, compared to the expected $8.99 per share. However, analysts have had plenty of good things to say about it. One of the best things about AutoZone is its $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The company's stock is up 5% year to date, including about 1% over the last five trading days. AutoZone also posted strong beats against the consensus estimates for its third fiscal quarter. The retailer reported $29.03 per share in earnings on $3.9 billion in revenue, compared to the consensus numbers of $26.21 per share and $3.7 billion.Don't Forget E-Commerce RetailersDespite the strength of the above brick-and-mortar auto parts retailers, another company that shouldn't be dismissed is Carparts.com Inc (NASDAQ:PRTS), an online retailer of auto partners in the U.S. Given consumers' propensity for shopping online, an online retailer should be a strong option.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksMitsubishi ElectricDriving mobilityMitsubishi ElectricLearn MoreUndo However, Carparts.com shares are down 23% year to date, even after the 28.5% rally over the last month, of which 15% has come during the last five trading days. The company did beat consensus estimates for the second quarter, posting earnings of 7 cents per share on $176.2 million in revenue. Analysts had been expecting losses of 3 cents per share on $175.8 million in revenue.Overall, the auto parts sector looks robust due to current secular trends, so retailers would do well to check out the above names to see whether they might fit in their portfolio.

Attractive, And Here Are Three Potential Picks    August 03, 2022 — 02:06 pm EDT       Written by                         Michelle Jones for                                       ValueWalk -> In 2021, one of the big stories for consumers was the global shortage of chips used in new vehicles. While the news may have died down a bit this year, the problem certainly hasn't gone away. In fact, auto industry experts told Automotive News Canada toward the end of June that the shortage of new vehicles is likely to last ""well into next year, if not 2024.""Q2 2022 hedge fund letters, conferences and more   Two Trends That Support The Thesis For Auto Part StocksThe issue has resulted in two trends, both of which support the thesis that auto parts stocks may be good buys right now. The first is that the prices for both new and used cars have skyrocketed over the last year. In June, Fortune reported that new vehicle prices had risen 12.6% year over year, while prices for used cars and trucks were up 16% since last year.The other trend has resulted from that first trend. The higher vehicle prices are causing drivers to keep their cars for significantly longer than they otherwise would. As a result, the need for repairs and auto parts is much higher than it would be otherwise.Further, the increasing likelihood of a recession will increase this need even more, making auto parts retailers a recession-resistant industry. After all, people in most suburban and rural markets still need to keep their vehicles in good working order so that they can get to work. Additionally, the average age of a vehicle on U.S. roads right now is about 12 years, a record high.Some Of The Biggest Names In The SpaceInvestors need only look around their neighborhood for the names of some of the largest brick-and-mortar auto parts retailers. Of course, while some of these companies may be particularly attractive buys, they aren't all created equal. Some of the retailers with the largest footprints include Autozone Inc (NYSE:AZO) and O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive shares are up 2% year to date and 10% over the last month, with half of that gain coming in the last five trading days. Unfortunately, the company missed the consensus estimate for its second-quarter earnings per share, coming in at $8.78 per share and $3.7 billion in revenue, compared to the expected $8.99 per share. However, analysts have had plenty of good things to say about it. One of the best things about AutoZone is its $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The company's stock is up 5% year to date, including about 1% over the last five trading days. AutoZone also posted strong beats against the consensus estimates for its third fiscal quarter. The retailer reported $29.03 per share in earnings on $3.9 billion in revenue, compared to the consensus numbers of $26.21 per share and $3.7 billion.Don't Forget E-Commerce RetailersDespite the strength of the above brick-and-mortar auto parts retailers, another company that shouldn't be dismissed is Carparts.com Inc (NASDAQ:PRTS), an online retailer of auto partners in the U.S. Given consumers' propensity for shopping online, an online retailer should be a strong option.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksMitsubishi ElectricDriving mobilityMitsubishi ElectricLearn MoreUndo However, Carparts.com shares are down 23% year to date, even after the 28.5% rally over the last month, of which 15% has come during the last five trading days. The company did beat consensus estimates for the second quarter, posting earnings of 7 cents per share on $176.2 million in revenue. Analysts had been expecting losses of 3 cents per share on $175.8 million in revenue.Overall, the auto parts sector looks robust due to current secular trends, so retailers would do well to check out the above names to see whether they might fit in their portfolio.

With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

If you have a specific risk preference and/or a strong belief in where the automotive industry is headed, there will be an exciting stock to invest in on this list. If you’re investing in OEM parts stocks, just remember to keep an eye on industry forecasts for LPV and how auto suppliers are planning to increase CPV. For the aftermarket, the key is to follow miles driven and how a company competes within its end markets. Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Investing > Stock Market > Market Sectors > Consumer Discretionary > Automotive Stocks > Auto Parts Stocks Investing in Auto Parts & OEM Stocks By Lee Samaha – Updated Nov 9, 2023 at 4:17PM Source: Getty Images Auto parts stocks offer something for every type of investor -- whether you’re an aggressive investor looking to invest in blue-sky technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) and driverless cars, or a risk-averse investor worried about a recession. With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

If you’re investing in OEM parts stocks, just remember to keep an eye on industry forecasts for LPV and how auto suppliers are planning to increase CPV. For the aftermarket, the key is to follow miles driven and how a company competes within its end markets. Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Investing > Stock Market > Market Sectors > Consumer Discretionary > Automotive Stocks > Auto Parts Stocks Investing in Auto Parts & OEM Stocks By Lee Samaha – Updated Nov 9, 2023 at 4:17PM Source: Getty Images Auto parts stocks offer something for every type of investor -- whether you’re an aggressive investor looking to invest in blue-sky technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) and driverless cars, or a risk-averse investor worried about a recession. With that in mind, let’s dive in and take a look at the key stocks in the industry.Auto parts industry stocksLooking at matters thematically, there are three overlapping ways to think about investing in the automotive industry: Stocks benefitting from the aftermarket and replacement markets.Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts suppliers and companies that benefit from increased light vehicle production (LVP), which covers automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles such as vans.Essentially a subset of the first group, many OEM suppliers aim to increase content per vehicle (CPV) through technological development or shift in demand. CPV refers to the value of a company’s products on a vehicle.Those three bullet point groupings are somewhat arbitrary, and many companies are in two or even all three groups. Still, the model serves as a helpful guide for investing in the automotive and transportation industry. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data current as of March 10, 2023. Company Market Capitalization Key Activity LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) $14.6 billion Vehicle replacement parts used in the vehicle collision and mechanical replacement market. Has a very small OEM business. Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) $3.1 billion Manufacturer of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, aircraft, etc. O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) $50.7 billion Auto parts retailer. Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) $12.7 billion Tools, equipment, and diagnostics for auto professionals. Axalta Coating Systems (NASDAQ:AXTA) $6.5 billion High-performance coatings. Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) $30.1 billion Vehicle components focused on electrical, electronic, active safety technology, and networking architecture. Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) $7.9 billion Passive safety systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels. BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) $11.2 billion Propulsion systems and electrification products. Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) $6.3 billion Dimmable rearview mirrors, digital vision, dimmable glass, mirrors, and electronics. 1. LKQ CorporationLKQ Corporation is a major player in the aftermarket and replacement part market. It's a relatively stable end market because its growth prospects depend on the number of miles driven by light vehicles. More miles driven means more vehicle collisions and more wear and tear -- all good news for LKQ.The company’s global reach makes it the leading player in North America and Europe. Management plans to use its scale to gain market share by having more car parts inventory available than competitors. 2. GoodyearSimilarly, tire manufacturer Goodyear tends to generate three-quarters of its unit sales from the replacement market instead of OEM. If you’re going to invest in aftermarket plays, the key is to ensure the company is generating growth through winning market share.That’s something that Goodyear will do following its acquisition of fellow tire company Cooper. The deal will help build scale and expand profit margins at the leading U.S. tire manufacturer. Ultimately, Goodyear will aim to reach the kind of profit margins enjoyed by market leaders Bridgestone and Michelin.3. O’Reilly AutomotiveGiven the aftermarket size, there are plenty of under-the-radar ways to play the sector. The key metrics to look out for here are miles driven and the average age of the car fleet. As noted above, more miles driven means more cars serviced, and older cars tend to need more servicing.That's music to the ears of the auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone (AZO  0.11%), and Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -0.25%). They are an exciting and rare collection of stocks because they’re often seen as being recession-proof. The argument is that consumers tend to delay purchasing new cars in recessionary periods in favor of running older vehicles longer.The best in class is O’Reilly Automotive due to its relatively greater exposure to the higher-growth Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market. The DIFM is seen as having greater growth potential due to the increasing complexity of automobiles. Moreover, O'Reilly has a better track record of ensuring the timely delivery of parts -- a major plus for the DIFM customer. 4. Snap-onSnap-on is a global provider of tools, diagnostics equipment, and information systems to dealerships and auto repair shops. In fact, nearly two-thirds of Snap-on’s sales go to vehicle repair shops and vehicle technicians.Consequently, demand for Snap-on products tends to be driven by the number of vehicles serviced and the increasingly complex vehicle systems integrated into automobiles. In addition, the rising age of the average U.S. light vehicle is likely to spur ongoing demand for servicing. 5. Axalta Coating SystemsAnother under-the-radar way to participate in the auto parts market is to buy into painting and coating companies. Investors should take a look at Axalta Coating Systems since the automotive market makes up nearly three-quarters of its sales, with the refinish market being its highest-margin activity.Axalta offers investors a way to benefit from both the aftermarket (refinishing) and OEM market. Moreover, given that cars will need coating whether they’re internal combustion, hybrid, or electric vehicles, Axalta offers a way to profit regardless of the changes in the industry. 6. AptivThe leading U.S.-listed OEM parts players are Magna International (MGA  -1.22%), Lear Corporation (LEA  -1.04%), Aptiv, BorgWarner, and Autoliv.The key difference between the OEM and aftermarket stocks is that investors in the OEM suppliers need to follow light vehicle production figures. More production usually means more profit, so car production is the key metric to track. The OEM market tends to have a small number of customers -- the major car manufacturers -- while the aftermarket has many customers. For example, Aptiv's customers include 23 of the largest 25 automotive OEMs.As a result, OEM supply contracts are nearly always keenly contested. The suppliers have intimate relationships with manufacturers and stay close to them in terms of production plants and also in terms of product development. Ultimately, the name of the game for OEM suppliers is to win contracts to benefit from increased LVP and to boost CPV.Aptiv plans to do that by winning out in the driverless car market. The company is the leading provider of the architecture necessary for driverless cars. As such, the stock is a technology play, as well as a way to play rising OEM production.7. AutolivAutoliv's long-term sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate, compared to a low-single-digit rate for LVP. The primary growth driver has been the development of safety technology and industry adoption of airbags and seatbelts. The company claims more than 40% of the global market for passive safety, so Autoliv offers investors an opportunity to profit from increasing global car production and an increased awareness of the need for safety in vehicles.8. BorgWarnerBorgWarner provides drivetrain and powertrain solutions to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market. However, as car sales and production are increasingly shifting toward hybrids and EVs, BorgWarner is investing in propulsion systems for them and making a slew of acquisitions in the electrification area. For example, BorgWarner bought Delphi Technologies (power electronics) in 2020 to add to its CPV on electric light vehicles.ICE vehicles won't disappear overnight, so BorgWarner and others still have many years of earnings to generate from the ICE market. Still, the auto OEM suppliers must adjust to the reality of a long-term shift towards hybrid and EVs.For investors who want some exposure to the automotive OEM market, a diversified industrial conglomerate with substantive automotive and automotive materials might fill the bill. Two names that immediately spring to mind are 3M (MMM  -1.22%) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -1.13%). 9. GentexInvestors looking for a relatively safe technology play may like digital vision and dimmable mirror technology company Gentex. The company is the overwhelmingly dominant supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors to the automotive industry, with Magna being a very distant second.Dimmable mirrors tend to be a premium option on vehicles, and Gentex's management believes it can increase revenue through automakers increasingly adopting them as an option. In addition, Gentex has a growth opportunity through developing sales of its full display mirrors and camera systems as customers increasingly demand advanced technology in automobiles.

A sector to invest in?The auto parts industry offers something for every investor, ranging from high risk/high reward types of technology plays, through balanced risk options such as Gentex or BorgWarner, all the way to recession-resistant options such as auto parts retailers. If you have a specific risk preference and/or a strong belief in where the automotive industry is headed, there will be an exciting stock to invest in on this list. If you’re investing in OEM parts stocks, just remember to keep an eye on industry forecasts for LPV and how auto suppliers are planning to increase CPV. For the aftermarket, the key is to follow miles driven and how a company competes within its end markets. Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Zacks Equity Research for                                       Zacks -> The auto retail industry is on a roll, thanks to increasing demand for vehicles amid preference for private transportation and economic growth. Thanks to unprecedented fiscal stimulus and stepped-up vaccination drive, the economy is soaring and consumer spending is on the rise, with Americans being way more confident to make discretionary purchases. U.S. auto sales continued to gather steam in second-quarter 2021, thanks to easier credit conditions, bullish consumer sentiment, soaring popularity of electric vehicles and rapid digitization. With millions of Americans now fully vaccinated, more people are expected to go out and the momentum in vehicle demand is likely to continue. While the average prices of cars are on the rise amid chip crunch, demand is still accelerating, which is likely to result in higher profits for retailers. Amid the rosy prospects of the industry, O'Reilly Automotive ORLY appears to be an interesting choice for investors. O’Reilly’s revenue growth is impressive. The specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts has been generating record revenues for 28 consecutive years on the back of stable growth in the auto parts market and expansion of the store base. In addition to opening stores in new markets, the company has been actively increasing store count in less-populated areas. It opened 68 new stores during first-quarter 2021, bringing the total store count to 5,682 as of Mar 31, 2021. O'Reilly’s penetration in new and contiguous markets will help in business growth in markets across the country. The firm’s buyout of Mayasa Auto Parts bodes well and marks O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction.The company has a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy and a strong distribution network. O’Reilly’s wide-ranging product portfolio caters to DIY (“Do-It-Yourself”) and DIFM (“Do-it-for-Me”) customers, which are driving comparable store sales growth. The company delivered exceptional comps sales growth and EBIT performance in the last reported quarter due to robust demand for DIY-based projects, market share gains as well as elimination of maintenance deferrals. Moreover, growing demand for technologically advanced auto parts is likely to drive O’Reilly’s prospects. Increased complexity of auto parts and repairs is driving more people to independent repair shops. Thus, as cars as getting more technologically advanced, high-quality auto parts are much in demand, which are likely to bolster O’Reilly’s sales and earnings in the future.Year to date, the stock have increased 28.5%, surpassing the industry and S&P 500’s growth of 21.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The company has significantly outperformed the auto sector, which has lost 1.8% during the same time period.Year-to-Date PerformanceImage Source: Zacks Investment Research O’Reilly — which shares space with Advance Auto parts AAP, AutoZone AZO and CarMax KMX — currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

O'Reilly (ORLY)    July 09, 2021 — 10:56 am EDT       Written by                         Zacks Equity Research for                                       Zacks -> The auto retail industry is on a roll, thanks to increasing demand for vehicles amid preference for private transportation and economic growth. Thanks to unprecedented fiscal stimulus and stepped-up vaccination drive, the economy is soaring and consumer spending is on the rise, with Americans being way more confident to make discretionary purchases. U.S. auto sales continued to gather steam in second-quarter 2021, thanks to easier credit conditions, bullish consumer sentiment, soaring popularity of electric vehicles and rapid digitization. With millions of Americans now fully vaccinated, more people are expected to go out and the momentum in vehicle demand is likely to continue. While the average prices of cars are on the rise amid chip crunch, demand is still accelerating, which is likely to result in higher profits for retailers. Amid the rosy prospects of the industry, O'Reilly Automotive ORLY appears to be an interesting choice for investors. O’Reilly’s revenue growth is impressive. The specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts has been generating record revenues for 28 consecutive years on the back of stable growth in the auto parts market and expansion of the store base. In addition to opening stores in new markets, the company has been actively increasing store count in less-populated areas. It opened 68 new stores during first-quarter 2021, bringing the total store count to 5,682 as of Mar 31, 2021. O'Reilly’s penetration in new and contiguous markets will help in business growth in markets across the country. The firm’s buyout of Mayasa Auto Parts bodes well and marks O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction.The company has a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy and a strong distribution network. O’Reilly’s wide-ranging product portfolio caters to DIY (“Do-It-Yourself”) and DIFM (“Do-it-for-Me”) customers, which are driving comparable store sales growth. The company delivered exceptional comps sales growth and EBIT performance in the last reported quarter due to robust demand for DIY-based projects, market share gains as well as elimination of maintenance deferrals. Moreover, growing demand for technologically advanced auto parts is likely to drive O’Reilly’s prospects. Increased complexity of auto parts and repairs is driving more people to independent repair shops. Thus, as cars as getting more technologically advanced, high-quality auto parts are much in demand, which are likely to bolster O’Reilly’s sales and earnings in the future.Year to date, the stock have increased 28.5%, surpassing the industry and S&P 500’s growth of 21.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The company has significantly outperformed the auto sector, which has lost 1.8% during the same time period.Year-to-Date PerformanceImage Source: Zacks Investment Research O’Reilly — which shares space with Advance Auto parts AAP, AutoZone AZO and CarMax KMX — currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

O'Reilly (ORLY)    July 09, 2021 — 10:56 am EDT       Written by                         Zacks Equity Research for                                       Zacks -> The auto retail industry is on a roll, thanks to increasing demand for vehicles amid preference for private transportation and economic growth. Thanks to unprecedented fiscal stimulus and stepped-up vaccination drive, the economy is soaring and consumer spending is on the rise, with Americans being way more confident to make discretionary purchases. U.S. auto sales continued to gather steam in second-quarter 2021, thanks to easier credit conditions, bullish consumer sentiment, soaring popularity of electric vehicles and rapid digitization. With millions of Americans now fully vaccinated, more people are expected to go out and the momentum in vehicle demand is likely to continue. While the average prices of cars are on the rise amid chip crunch, demand is still accelerating, which is likely to result in higher profits for retailers. Amid the rosy prospects of the industry, O'Reilly Automotive ORLY appears to be an interesting choice for investors. O’Reilly’s revenue growth is impressive. The specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts has been generating record revenues for 28 consecutive years on the back of stable growth in the auto parts market and expansion of the store base. In addition to opening stores in new markets, the company has been actively increasing store count in less-populated areas. It opened 68 new stores during first-quarter 2021, bringing the total store count to 5,682 as of Mar 31, 2021. O'Reilly’s penetration in new and contiguous markets will help in business growth in markets across the country. The firm’s buyout of Mayasa Auto Parts bodes well and marks O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction.The company has a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy and a strong distribution network. O’Reilly’s wide-ranging product portfolio caters to DIY (“Do-It-Yourself”) and DIFM (“Do-it-for-Me”) customers, which are driving comparable store sales growth. The company delivered exceptional comps sales growth and EBIT performance in the last reported quarter due to robust demand for DIY-based projects, market share gains as well as elimination of maintenance deferrals. Moreover, growing demand for technologically advanced auto parts is likely to drive O’Reilly’s prospects. Increased complexity of auto parts and repairs is driving more people to independent repair shops. Thus, as cars as getting more technologically advanced, high-quality auto parts are much in demand, which are likely to bolster O’Reilly’s sales and earnings in the future.Year to date, the stock have increased 28.5%, surpassing the industry and S&P 500’s growth of 21.8% and 16.8%, respectively. The company has significantly outperformed the auto sector, which has lost 1.8% during the same time period.Year-to-Date PerformanceImage Source: Zacks Investment Research O’Reilly — which shares space with Advance Auto parts AAP, AutoZone AZO and CarMax KMX — currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company's financial picture remains precarious, with significant expenditures in 2023 as it works to increase production.Canoo will soon face a greater number of competitors in the passenger and commercial van segments, as new models arrive.Canoo's futuristic electric van was first revealed in 2019, promising an innovative design along with an electric powertrain and a cavernous interior—ingredients that seemed to speak to a segment of the van-life crowd.  Since that time, as it has inched closer to something resembling volume production, Canoo has reoriented itself from potential retail customers to commercial orders. The latest such order was revealed a few days ago, with Prime Time Shuttle set to purchase up to 550 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicles.  Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowRelated StoryCanoo Is Already Testing Its EV Vans with WalmartThe LVs will be used as shuttles in the Los Angeles area, though in the longer term the company hopes to use them outside of LA as well. Just a few days ago Canoo also said it has received an EPA permit for its assembly site in Oklahoma City and has delivered its first Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV) to the state, part of an order of some 1000 units. The startup is now in the process of hiring working for its production facility in the state.However, Canoo's finances remain precarious. CanooCanoo has lately turned to commercial buyers for its electric vans, which offer the promise of large contracts.The startup posted a loss of $112 million in the third quarter of this year, with $8.3 million in cash and equivalents remaining at the end of September. For the first nine months of 2023 Canoo posted a loss of $273.6 million, along with revenue of just $519,000.""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, investor, executive chairman, and CEO of Canoo.Canoo will face some direct competition from Volkswagen when the ID. Buzz arrives in the US in 2024.Just days ago Canoo also revealed a four-door pickup version of its van vaguely resembling a VW DoKa, dubbed American Bulldog, eager to capitalize on the EV pickup craze currently gathering momentum in the market. The truck itself is based on the Screaming Eagle prototypes delivered to the US military for testing in 2022.But the company has not made any estimates of production timelines or pricing.The highest-profile news from the company this year was perhaps the reveal of Crew Transport Vehicles for NASA's Artemis program. The first flight has been scheduled for November 2024, with the electric shuttles set play the role of Airstream motorhomes that had taken shuttle astronauts to the launch pad in the past.Related StoryCanoo’s NASA Crew Transports Get Ready for TakeoffWhile that piece of news may have been the high point of Canoo's year in terms of publicity, it also underscored just how much the startup is still relying on niche orders from commercial customers that are far from being completed. In some ways it also reflects the typical problems experienced by EV startups whose future products were revealed in concept form in one economic and consumer landscape, but arrived on sale in a markedly different one, facing challengers from established automakers. And as other startups with long product gestation periods, it is also seeing the EV market evolve faster than it can deliver its promised goods.Related StoryVW Microbus Legacy Paves the Way for ID. BuzzIn 2024 Canoo will face some direct competition from Volkswagen when the ID. Buzz arrives on sale in the US after a long development cycle. Canoo's commercial vans, meanwhile, will also see competition from Rivian and BrightDrop's delivery vans.In the face of this competition, it's prudent to ask just how Canoo hopes to set itself apart in the coming years from much larger challengers, as commercial and private customers alike become more interested in price points and dealer support rather than innovation. Will demand for electric vans grow in the coming years, or are most buyers still focused on crossovers and SUVs? Let us know in the comments below.Jay RameyJay Ramey grew up around very strange European cars, and instead of seeking out something reliable and comfortable for his own personal use he has been drawn to the more adventurous side of the dependability spectrum. Despite being followed around by French cars for the past decade, he has somehow been able to avoid Citroën ownership, judging them too commonplace, and is currently looking at cars from the former Czechoslovakia. Jay has been with Autoweek since 2013. Read full bioElectric VehiclesAs Cyberattacks Ramp Up, EVs Are VulnerableConsensus Is Building to Fight Climate ChangeSeven Automakers Are Launching a Charging NetworkChrysler Halcyon EV Concept PhotosAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowDoes Halcyon EV Concept Embody Chrysler’s Future?This EV Charging Hub Is the First of Its KindEV Startup Arrival Has Entered a Critical Stage2025 Lotus Emeya Is Sub-Zero Certified Iron Man Is Selling His Cars; You Can Own OneThis EV Wagon Isn’t for Us, but One Other Could BeVolvo Begins Building Electric MinivanClubman Assembly Ends, but a Replacement Is ComingAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout UsNewsCar LifeRacingContact UsNewsletterCar RankingsPodcastsHearst AutosCareersGear GuideA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Autos, Inc.

https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2024-canoo-lifestyle-vehicle-first-drive-review/,"2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle First Drive Review: Rocking the Boat, Celebrate 75 YearsLearn MoreNewsReviewsBuyer's GuideWatchMotorTrend+The FutureEventsSweepstakesJoin MotorTrend2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle First Drive Review: Rocking the BoatIt’s not so much a car, truck, or van, as it is a rolling amalgamation of convention-defying unique selling propositions—most of which we pretty much dig.Frank MarkusWriterManufacturerPhotographerDec 1, 2022View Gallery48 PhotosWell, if there's one thing our favorite electric vehicle startups have all shared, it's a penchant for innovation—from luxury hatchbacks with third-row seats and SUVs with ""falcon-wing"" doors, to trucks with gear tunnels and supercar suspensions, to 500-mile sedans powered by 500-plus-hp motors tiny and light enough to fit in a roll-aboard suitcase. Now we're adding to that roster the 2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle—a 21-window retrotastic van with mosh-pit seating, swappable ""top-hat"" bodies, and a truly fresh take on vehicle life-cycle planning.Click to UnmuteClick to UnmuteWatch: 2024 Canoo MPDV Delivery Van Revealed!Is Canoo Viable?It's a question worth asking about any EV startup that hasn't yet produced cars yet, and things indeed looked a little shaky last year for the California-based firm. But like Rivian, Canoo is lining up fleet customers to keep the lights on (e.g., Walmart has ordered 4,500 LDVs, or Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles). Unlike Rivian, Canoo will only be selling to fleet customers for the first year of production. (Those customers will also hopefully soon include the U.S. military, for Canoo's Light Tactical Vehicle that we also reviewed.) These fleets will expose the vehicle to harder use than retail families would, and so will swiftly and efficiently uncover any remaining development issues prior to the retail launch of the passenger-carrying Lifestyle Vehicle.More Canoo:Canoo LV Buyer's GuideWe Drive Canoo's Army PickupSee Canoo Crash TestingCanoo's FutureThe VW Microbus-esque Lifestyle Vehicle was the first Canoo to break cover, and a simpler delivery-van version of that body is the first to launch. The first 120 ""Gamma"" prototypes of various models have been built in Livonia, Michigan, at Roush Industries (we drove one of these not quite final-final models). Roush has provided worker training and assembly services, but the tooling and manufacturing process all belong to Canoo, and the employees overseeing them have either been flown in from Oklahoma or hired locally by Canoo with plans to relocate to Oklahoma when official production migrates there in the first quarter of 2023.The first official customer vehicles began rolling off this temporary line on November 17, bound for Walmart, NASA, and other fleet buyers. Pickup variants (in regular, extended, and crew cab configurations) are still part of the product plan, and we're assured features like the drop-down sides, gear-tunnel drawers, extending pickup floor, and ""barn-door"" tailgate are still part of the plan. The larger, more angular Multi-Purpose Delivery Van (MPDV) program is also still active. And current production plans call for initially producing more skateboards than top hats, suggesting the company sees a market for this low-profile, fully by-wire platform.View Gallery48 PhotosInside the Lifestyle VehicleSimply climbing aboard is a unique experience. The front doors are wide and rectangular, meaning there's open space right where your head usually ducks under an A-pillar. The rear doors are also wide and swing open on rear-mounted hinges—like on a Rolls-Royce or Lincoln Continental Coach Door. And as in those cars, the main bench seat is positioned behind the C-pillar, leaving floorspace sufficient for practicing yoga (or mounting a wheelchair ramp). Premium models get jump seats that mount to the doors, with retractable seat bottoms and full three-point belts. When deployed, their occupants face each other, and unoccupied cushions can serve as ottomans for the outboard bench-seat occupants. Two more jump seats fold down behind each front seatback, but they're only for use when stopped, with the front seatbacks leaned forward. The rear-door windows don't go down, but the rear quarter windows do, and there will be an option to have the little vista windows around the roof perimeter pop open.When folded up against the front seatbacks, wings on the temporary jump seats serve as outboard armrests for the front occupants—which they need, because moving the front seats far enough inboard for the driver's feet to clear the front wheels puts the doors out of reach. The pedal environment is perfect, but while there's a single center armrest between the seats, there's no room for a center console, and two burly linebackers might rub shoulders.There's no ""dashboard."" A digital speedometer readout and indicators for the turn signal and drive gear are centered at the base of the windshield. Below this is another window offering a view of what's immediately in front. That panel may one day open to access stowage space ahead of the front occupants' feet. Multiple thin pillars separating the various glass panels ahead of the official A-pillar didn't prove distracting and overall visibility is excellent.View Gallery48 PhotosA 10.0-inch touchscreen mounts to the driver's A-pillar, within easy reach of the steering wheel. It controls most secondary functions (rails above and below are planned, for steadying a hand on bumpy roads). That screen seems designed to minimize distraction, offering few compelling infographics … yet. Wiper controls share the turn-signal stalk, while the right stalk serves as the gear selector. Climate controls are arrayed across a slim aluminum cross-car beam, within reach of the passenger. The HVAC system is convective, relying on circulating air, not air that directly blows on the occupants. As such there are no vent registers visible except a row along the top of the windshield. In 40-degree weather, the 72-degree setting quickly felt comfortable with no dry eyes, but the tougher test will be how quickly such a system can make occupants feel cool on a hot day—especially in a vehicle with so much glass.Canoo's seating arrangement prioritizes excellent comfort for four or five, passable comfort for seven (in those premium models), and not much cargo flexibility—of the 130 cubic feet of space available in the LDV, there's only room for 13.0 cubes of stuff (or three golf bags) behind the folding-backrest, non-removable rear seat. It's NOT a minivan, remember?Is It a Legit Muscle Van?Riding on the wheelbase of a Toyota Prius with by-wire steering controlled by a square steering ""wheel"" twirling a lightning-quick rack (1.2 turns lock-to-lock), it feels nimble and quick-witted, and the turning circle is crazy tight. The skateboard chassis features patented composite transverse leaf springs of variable cross-section, which helps keep the entire suspension low—the tops of the shocks are about even with the tops of the tires. The LV swallows speed bumps with suppleness, while minimal body lean, squat, and dive suggest a certain sportiness. This isn't a ""forward-control"" van like a Microbus, but the upright, forward seating position places the driver's eyes unusually close to the steering axle. Combine this with that speedy steering and we managed to clip the first curb or two. Braking regen is programmable in three levels ranging from unobtrusively light to full one-pedal driving.The rear-mounted 200-pound motor, which Canoo designed, builds, and holds 58 patents on, is capable of 350 hp and 304 lb-ft. Canoo envisions making output programmable between 200 and 350 hp, with lower power boosting efficiency, reducing wear and tear, and potentially lowering use-based insurance costs. It was set to 285 hp for our drive, and in a 4,750-pound vehicle with three people onboard, its weight-to-power was worse than that of a Chevy Bolt EV or Nissan Leaf.  Canoo's 9.7:1 gear reduction ratio is notably shorter than those two, though, so it accelerates more snappily, but it's certainly no rail gun. A future two-motor AWD version with both motors cranked to max output may wear the muscle-van moniker more comfortably.Unique Sales PropositionCanoo originally proposed an all-subscription model, but inflation and volatile interest rates complicate such a model. Retail sales and leasing will primarily be handled online and directly with the factory. Canoo contends that the value of a vehicle is ultimately determined by its second and third owners. Toward that end, the company's skateboard design prioritizes longevity and quick, easy repairability with lifelong upgradability. A powertrain swap takes two hours, and the entire body top hat shouldn't take much longer. In this way, the Canoo recalls a different vintage VW—the Beetle—many of which enjoyed second lives as sand rails and dune buggies.View Gallery48 PhotosBottom LineWe've loved the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle's exterior design from the moment we saw it (especially the pickup). We're intrigued with the interior layout and we look forward to spending more time in it to answer questions like, is supreme footstool comfort for two rear occupants some of the time worth making occupants six and seven miserable sitting sideways?

Now we're adding to that roster the 2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle—a 21-window retrotastic van with mosh-pit seating, swappable ""top-hat"" bodies, and a truly fresh take on vehicle life-cycle planning.Click to UnmuteClick to UnmuteWatch: 2024 Canoo MPDV Delivery Van Revealed!Is Canoo Viable?It's a question worth asking about any EV startup that hasn't yet produced cars yet, and things indeed looked a little shaky last year for the California-based firm. But like Rivian, Canoo is lining up fleet customers to keep the lights on (e.g., Walmart has ordered 4,500 LDVs, or Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles). Unlike Rivian, Canoo will only be selling to fleet customers for the first year of production. (Those customers will also hopefully soon include the U.S. military, for Canoo's Light Tactical Vehicle that we also reviewed.) These fleets will expose the vehicle to harder use than retail families would, and so will swiftly and efficiently uncover any remaining development issues prior to the retail launch of the passenger-carrying Lifestyle Vehicle.More Canoo:Canoo LV Buyer's GuideWe Drive Canoo's Army PickupSee Canoo Crash TestingCanoo's FutureThe VW Microbus-esque Lifestyle Vehicle was the first Canoo to break cover, and a simpler delivery-van version of that body is the first to launch. The first 120 ""Gamma"" prototypes of various models have been built in Livonia, Michigan, at Roush Industries (we drove one of these not quite final-final models). Roush has provided worker training and assembly services, but the tooling and manufacturing process all belong to Canoo, and the employees overseeing them have either been flown in from Oklahoma or hired locally by Canoo with plans to relocate to Oklahoma when official production migrates there in the first quarter of 2023.The first official customer vehicles began rolling off this temporary line on November 17, bound for Walmart, NASA, and other fleet buyers. Pickup variants (in regular, extended, and crew cab configurations) are still part of the product plan, and we're assured features like the drop-down sides, gear-tunnel drawers, extending pickup floor, and ""barn-door"" tailgate are still part of the plan. The larger, more angular Multi-Purpose Delivery Van (MPDV) program is also still active. And current production plans call for initially producing more skateboards than top hats, suggesting the company sees a market for this low-profile, fully by-wire platform.View Gallery48 PhotosInside the Lifestyle VehicleSimply climbing aboard is a unique experience. The front doors are wide and rectangular, meaning there's open space right where your head usually ducks under an A-pillar. The rear doors are also wide and swing open on rear-mounted hinges—like on a Rolls-Royce or Lincoln Continental Coach Door. And as in those cars, the main bench seat is positioned behind the C-pillar, leaving floorspace sufficient for practicing yoga (or mounting a wheelchair ramp). Premium models get jump seats that mount to the doors, with retractable seat bottoms and full three-point belts. When deployed, their occupants face each other, and unoccupied cushions can serve as ottomans for the outboard bench-seat occupants. Two more jump seats fold down behind each front seatback, but they're only for use when stopped, with the front seatbacks leaned forward. The rear-door windows don't go down, but the rear quarter windows do, and there will be an option to have the little vista windows around the roof perimeter pop open.When folded up against the front seatbacks, wings on the temporary jump seats serve as outboard armrests for the front occupants—which they need, because moving the front seats far enough inboard for the driver's feet to clear the front wheels puts the doors out of reach. The pedal environment is perfect, but while there's a single center armrest between the seats, there's no room for a center console, and two burly linebackers might rub shoulders.There's no ""dashboard."" A digital speedometer readout and indicators for the turn signal and drive gear are centered at the base of the windshield. Below this is another window offering a view of what's immediately in front. That panel may one day open to access stowage space ahead of the front occupants' feet. Multiple thin pillars separating the various glass panels ahead of the official A-pillar didn't prove distracting and overall visibility is excellent.View Gallery48 PhotosA 10.0-inch touchscreen mounts to the driver's A-pillar, within easy reach of the steering wheel. It controls most secondary functions (rails above and below are planned, for steadying a hand on bumpy roads). That screen seems designed to minimize distraction, offering few compelling infographics … yet. Wiper controls share the turn-signal stalk, while the right stalk serves as the gear selector. Climate controls are arrayed across a slim aluminum cross-car beam, within reach of the passenger. The HVAC system is convective, relying on circulating air, not air that directly blows on the occupants. As such there are no vent registers visible except a row along the top of the windshield. In 40-degree weather, the 72-degree setting quickly felt comfortable with no dry eyes, but the tougher test will be how quickly such a system can make occupants feel cool on a hot day—especially in a vehicle with so much glass.Canoo's seating arrangement prioritizes excellent comfort for four or five, passable comfort for seven (in those premium models), and not much cargo flexibility—of the 130 cubic feet of space available in the LDV, there's only room for 13.0 cubes of stuff (or three golf bags) behind the folding-backrest, non-removable rear seat. It's NOT a minivan, remember?Is It a Legit Muscle Van?Riding on the wheelbase of a Toyota Prius with by-wire steering controlled by a square steering ""wheel"" twirling a lightning-quick rack (1.2 turns lock-to-lock), it feels nimble and quick-witted, and the turning circle is crazy tight. The skateboard chassis features patented composite transverse leaf springs of variable cross-section, which helps keep the entire suspension low—the tops of the shocks are about even with the tops of the tires. The LV swallows speed bumps with suppleness, while minimal body lean, squat, and dive suggest a certain sportiness. This isn't a ""forward-control"" van like a Microbus, but the upright, forward seating position places the driver's eyes unusually close to the steering axle. Combine this with that speedy steering and we managed to clip the first curb or two. Braking regen is programmable in three levels ranging from unobtrusively light to full one-pedal driving.The rear-mounted 200-pound motor, which Canoo designed, builds, and holds 58 patents on, is capable of 350 hp and 304 lb-ft.

The company's financial picture remains precarious, with significant expenditures in 2023 as it works to increase production.Canoo will soon face a greater number of competitors in the passenger and commercial van segments, as new models arrive.Canoo's futuristic electric van was first revealed in 2019, promising an innovative design along with an electric powertrain and a cavernous interior—ingredients that seemed to speak to a segment of the van-life crowd.  Since that time, as it has inched closer to something resembling volume production, Canoo has reoriented itself from potential retail customers to commercial orders. The latest such order was revealed a few days ago, with Prime Time Shuttle set to purchase up to 550 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicles.

Just a few days ago Canoo also said it has received an EPA permit for its assembly site in Oklahoma City and has delivered its first Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV) to the state, part of an order of some 1000 units. The startup is now in the process of hiring working for its production facility in the state.However, Canoo's finances remain precarious. CanooCanoo has lately turned to commercial buyers for its electric vans, which offer the promise of large contracts.The startup posted a loss of $112 million in the third quarter of this year, with $8.3 million in cash and equivalents remaining at the end of September. For the first nine months of 2023 Canoo posted a loss of $273.6 million, along with revenue of just $519,000.""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, investor, executive chairman, and CEO of Canoo.Canoo will face some direct competition from Volkswagen when the ID. Buzz arrives in the US in 2024.Just days ago Canoo also revealed a four-door pickup version of its van vaguely resembling a VW DoKa, dubbed American Bulldog, eager to capitalize on the EV pickup craze currently gathering momentum in the market. The truck itself is based on the Screaming Eagle prototypes delivered to the US military for testing in 2022.But the company has not made any estimates of production timelines or pricing.The highest-profile news from the company this year was perhaps the reveal of Crew Transport Vehicles for NASA's Artemis program. The first flight has been scheduled for November 2024, with the electric shuttles set play the role of Airstream motorhomes that had taken shuttle astronauts to the launch pad in the past.Related StoryCanoo’s NASA Crew Transports Get Ready for TakeoffWhile that piece of news may have been the high point of Canoo's year in terms of publicity, it also underscored just how much the startup is still relying on niche orders from commercial customers that are far from being completed. In some ways it also reflects the typical problems experienced by EV startups whose future products were revealed in concept form in one economic and consumer landscape, but arrived on sale in a markedly different one, facing challengers from established automakers. And as other startups with long product gestation periods, it is also seeing the EV market evolve faster than it can deliver its promised goods.Related StoryVW Microbus Legacy Paves the Way for ID.

Canoo's commercial vans, meanwhile, will also see competition from Rivian and BrightDrop's delivery vans.In the face of this competition, it's prudent to ask just how Canoo hopes to set itself apart in the coming years from much larger challengers, as commercial and private customers alike become more interested in price points and dealer support rather than innovation.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Canoo: Buy, Sell, or Hold? By Courtney Carlsen – Jan 18, 2024 at 6:02AM Key Points Canoo is a startup taking a unique approach to electric vehicles. The company generated revenue for the first time in Q3. It continues to burn through cash, dilute shareholders, and faces questions about its ability to continue operations.  Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Market Cap $157M Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The electric-vehicle maker reached a significant milestone but faces big questions about its future. Canoo (GOEV -3.16%) has dreams of revolutionizing electric vehicles (EVs), bringing futuristic designs and a unique technological approach. However, the EV-maker's stock is down 99% since 2020, and for good reason. Its financial situation is uncertain, and the company continues to dilute shareholders to fund operations. If you're thinking about purchasing Canoo stock today because of its low share price, consider the following first. Arrows-In  Collapse  NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Today's Change (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Arrow-Thin-Down  YTD1w1m3m6m1y         5y                         -98.57%                      Price             VS S&P            GOEV     Key Data Points Market Cap $157M Day's Range $0.14 - $0.15 52wk Range $0.14 - $0.90 Volume 334,836 Avg Vol 53,890,015 Gross Margin -3092.10% Dividend Yield N/A Canoo's EV dreams Canoo is an EV company aiming to bring a unique approach to EVs with its futuristic look and advanced technology. The company has announced several vehicles as part of its lineup, including an electric van (Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle), an entry-level van (Multipurpose Delivery Vehicle or MPDV), and an electric pickup truck. Its vehicles offer interesting technological features, like advanced telematics and subscription-based services. Packed with sensors and connectivity features, the company's vehicles would allow for real-time monitoring of driving behavior, data analysis, and software updates over the air. Canoo produced revenue for the first time in Q3, but issues remain The company has received pre-orders from Walmart for up to 10,000 units, and orders from Zeeba, a fleet leasing operation, and KingBee, a work-ready van fleet rental company, for 12,300 vehicles. In November, the company delivered its first electric vehicles to the state of Oklahoma, where it manufactures its vehicles, which marked a significant milestone for the EV maker. Despite the news, Canoo is struggling to stay alive. It's trying to build a car company from scratch, which is far from easy. In the third quarter, the company generated $519,000 in revenue for the first time. This is a big feat that provides validation for the product. However, the company continues to burn cash. In the quarter, Canoo racked up over $48 million in operating expenses, and its net loss was $112 million. Through Sept. 30, its total losses for the year were $274 million, down from $407 million from the prior year. GOEV Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Keep an eye on Canoo's cash situation At the end of the quarter, Canoo has just $12 million in cash on its balance sheet, down from $40 million at the end of 2022. The company can access capital under an agreement with Evercore and H.C Wainwright & Co. to sell shares of common stock at an aggregate sales price of $200 million through an at-the-market offering program. Through the end of Q3, it still had $148 million in remaining capacity through this program. It also has a pre-paid advance agreement with Yorkville Advisors, with $137 million in remaining capacity through this facility. Despite this access to capital, Canoo still issued a going concern warning to investors. In its third-quarter 10-Q filing, it stated: The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in accordance with its operating plan and expects that both capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with its ongoing activities. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The company's capital raises have diluted shareholders substantially since it went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2020. Since then, its total shares outstanding went from around 236 million to over 726 million, a 208% increase. GOEV Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. Is Canoo a buy, sell, or hold? For Canoo to operate, it must continue diluting shareholders, which will put downward pressure on its share price. It's now a measly $0.21 per share as of this writing. The company keeps burning through cash and has its work cut out for it to ramp up production to reach commercial scale. Given the extreme uncertainty surrounding the company and questions about its ability to stay in business, I'd give the stock a sell rating and recommend looking for EV investment opportunities elsewhere.

By Courtney Carlsen – Jan 18, 2024 at 6:02AM Key Points Canoo is a startup taking a unique approach to electric vehicles. The company generated revenue for the first time in Q3. It continues to burn through cash, dilute shareholders, and faces questions about its ability to continue operations.  Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Market Cap $157M Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More The electric-vehicle maker reached a significant milestone but faces big questions about its future. Canoo (GOEV -3.16%) has dreams of revolutionizing electric vehicles (EVs), bringing futuristic designs and a unique technological approach. However, the EV-maker's stock is down 99% since 2020, and for good reason. Its financial situation is uncertain, and the company continues to dilute shareholders to fund operations. If you're thinking about purchasing Canoo stock today because of its low share price, consider the following first.

The company has announced several vehicles as part of its lineup, including an electric van (Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle), an entry-level van (Multipurpose Delivery Vehicle or MPDV), and an electric pickup truck. Its vehicles offer interesting technological features, like advanced telematics and subscription-based services. Packed with sensors and connectivity features, the company's vehicles would allow for real-time monitoring of driving behavior, data analysis, and software updates over the air. Canoo produced revenue for the first time in Q3, but issues remain The company has received pre-orders from Walmart for up to 10,000 units, and orders from Zeeba, a fleet leasing operation, and KingBee, a work-ready van fleet rental company, for 12,300 vehicles. In November, the company delivered its first electric vehicles to the state of Oklahoma, where it manufactures its vehicles, which marked a significant milestone for the EV maker. Despite the news, Canoo is struggling to stay alive. It's trying to build a car company from scratch, which is far from easy. In the third quarter, the company generated $519,000 in revenue for the first time. This is a big feat that provides validation for the product. However, the company continues to burn cash. In the quarter, Canoo racked up over $48 million in operating expenses, and its net loss was $112 million. Through Sept. 30, its total losses for the year were $274 million, down from $407 million from the prior year. GOEV Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Keep an eye on Canoo's cash situation At the end of the quarter, Canoo has just $12 million in cash on its balance sheet, down from $40 million at the end of 2022. The company can access capital under an agreement with Evercore and H.C Wainwright & Co. to sell shares of common stock at an aggregate sales price of $200 million through an at-the-market offering program. Through the end of Q3, it still had $148 million in remaining capacity through this program. It also has a pre-paid advance agreement with Yorkville Advisors, with $137 million in remaining capacity through this facility. Despite this access to capital, Canoo still issued a going concern warning to investors. In its third-quarter 10-Q filing, it stated: The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in accordance with its operating plan and expects that both capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with its ongoing activities. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The company's capital raises have diluted shareholders substantially since it went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2020. Since then, its total shares outstanding went from around 236 million to over 726 million, a 208% increase. GOEV Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. Is Canoo a buy, sell, or hold? For Canoo to operate, it must continue diluting shareholders, which will put downward pressure on its share price. It's now a measly $0.21 per share as of this writing. The company keeps burning through cash and has its work cut out for it to ramp up production to reach commercial scale. Given the extreme uncertainty surrounding the company and questions about its ability to stay in business, I'd give the stock a sell rating and recommend looking for EV investment opportunities elsewhere.

November 08, 2023 09:00 AM Tweet Share Share Email More   Tony Wanderon Over the past three years, the automotive industry has undergone significant changes, spurred by a global pandemic that disrupted vehicle supply chains, the rapid development of new technologies, and fluctuating interest rates. As manufacturers and dealerships have navigated this tumultuous landscape, they’ve been forced to adapt swiftly to the world’s ever-evolving demands. As we near the end of 2023, it’s crucial to look ahead and anticipate what 2024 might bring. With the rise of electric vehicle (EV) sales, inflation, and potential roadblocks stemming from strikes and parts shortages, the industry must stay vigilant and responsive to various market conditions and trends. EVs and Hybrid The shift towards electrification looks to have some headwinds in 2024. In 2023, EVs have been gaining momentum with a strong first half, up by 55% compared to the same period in the previous year.1 Today, four out of ten Americans are seriously considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase.2 However, higher than anticipated upfront costs, home charging, and the availability of free or for fee charging stations prove to bring some challenges to consumers today and into 2024. Even with growing an expanding network of charging stations, which alleviates some range anxiety.3  Interestingly, hybrids seem to be making inroads and are becoming an alternative of choice for OEMs and consumers.4 But the death of internal combustion (IC) vehicles seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as they will still be on the road for years to come.5  Emerging Technology Vehicles are evolving from mere means of transportation to fully connected devices. This transformation is prompting a shift in the overall vehicle experience, as manufacturers increasingly incorporate comprehensive software suites to facilitate integration with other smart devices. This digital shift is fostering personalized user experiences, enabling over-the-air updates, and leading to the development of more sophisticated infotainment systems. However, as vehicles become more connected, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks rises. Vehicle cyberthreats remain a significant concern for consumer cybersecurity6, necessitating that dealers offer robust training and comprehensive protection solutions to safeguard customers. The demand for personalized experiences extends to the car-buying process as well. In the post-pandemic era, there has been a noticeable shift towards digital tools in automotive retail. Today, 59% of car buyers prefer using digital tools provided by dealerships7, which facilitate various aspects of the buying process, including financing options, vehicle browsing, and educational resources to aid decision-making. Supply Chain Disruptions The pandemic unleashed widespread supply chain disruptions, from which the automotive industry is still recovering. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and ongoing semiconductor chip shortage brought more headwinds, resulting in a volatile market. Supply chain disruptions have broad-reaching implications, affecting dealerships and consumers alike. They lead to inventory shortages and drive-up vehicle prices.8 Between 2020 and 2021, the price of new cars surged by 17.2%.9 While vehicle prices are beginning to stabilize as inventory levels recover, dealerships must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to potential operational changes. The Takeaway While data and trends can provide insights into what 2024 may hold, it is impossible to predict the future with certainty. The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes driven by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, market demands, interest rates and global events. The past has shown that the world can change in an instant, underscoring the importance of resilience and staying well-informed as the automotive industry navigates the uncertainties of the coming year. 1Global EV Outlook, IEA 2“How Americans view electric vehicles,” Pew Research 3“The Number of Electric Vehicle Charging Ports in the U.S. Nearly Doubled in the Past Three Years,” Department of Energy 4“Gas-electric hybrid vehicles get a boost in the US from Ford, other,” Reuters 5“Stellantis sees long road ahead for internal combustion engine cars,” Reuters 6Global Cyber Security 2023 Study, CMS 7Buying Outlook, Capital One 8“Autoworkers’ Strike Could Affect New Car Prices,” Consumer Reports 9“Average car price is at an all-time high of $47,000 going into 2022,” The Zebra Letter to the Editor Send us a letter Have an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor, and we may publish it in print.

November 08, 2023 09:00 AM Tweet Share Share Email More   Tony Wanderon Over the past three years, the automotive industry has undergone significant changes, spurred by a global pandemic that disrupted vehicle supply chains, the rapid development of new technologies, and fluctuating interest rates. As manufacturers and dealerships have navigated this tumultuous landscape, they’ve been forced to adapt swiftly to the world’s ever-evolving demands. As we near the end of 2023, it’s crucial to look ahead and anticipate what 2024 might bring. With the rise of electric vehicle (EV) sales, inflation, and potential roadblocks stemming from strikes and parts shortages, the industry must stay vigilant and responsive to various market conditions and trends. EVs and Hybrid The shift towards electrification looks to have some headwinds in 2024. In 2023, EVs have been gaining momentum with a strong first half, up by 55% compared to the same period in the previous year.1 Today, four out of ten Americans are seriously considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase.2 However, higher than anticipated upfront costs, home charging, and the availability of free or for fee charging stations prove to bring some challenges to consumers today and into 2024. Even with growing an expanding network of charging stations, which alleviates some range anxiety.3  Interestingly, hybrids seem to be making inroads and are becoming an alternative of choice for OEMs and consumers.4 But the death of internal combustion (IC) vehicles seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as they will still be on the road for years to come.5  Emerging Technology Vehicles are evolving from mere means of transportation to fully connected devices. This transformation is prompting a shift in the overall vehicle experience, as manufacturers increasingly incorporate comprehensive software suites to facilitate integration with other smart devices. This digital shift is fostering personalized user experiences, enabling over-the-air updates, and leading to the development of more sophisticated infotainment systems. However, as vehicles become more connected, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks rises. Vehicle cyberthreats remain a significant concern for consumer cybersecurity6, necessitating that dealers offer robust training and comprehensive protection solutions to safeguard customers. The demand for personalized experiences extends to the car-buying process as well. In the post-pandemic era, there has been a noticeable shift towards digital tools in automotive retail. Today, 59% of car buyers prefer using digital tools provided by dealerships7, which facilitate various aspects of the buying process, including financing options, vehicle browsing, and educational resources to aid decision-making. Supply Chain Disruptions The pandemic unleashed widespread supply chain disruptions, from which the automotive industry is still recovering. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and ongoing semiconductor chip shortage brought more headwinds, resulting in a volatile market. Supply chain disruptions have broad-reaching implications, affecting dealerships and consumers alike. They lead to inventory shortages and drive-up vehicle prices.8 Between 2020 and 2021, the price of new cars surged by 17.2%.9 While vehicle prices are beginning to stabilize as inventory levels recover, dealerships must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to potential operational changes. The Takeaway While data and trends can provide insights into what 2024 may hold, it is impossible to predict the future with certainty. The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes driven by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, market demands, interest rates and global events. The past has shown that the world can change in an instant, underscoring the importance of resilience and staying well-informed as the automotive industry navigates the uncertainties of the coming year. 1Global EV Outlook, IEA 2“How Americans view electric vehicles,” Pew Research 3“The Number of Electric Vehicle Charging Ports in the U.S. Nearly Doubled in the Past Three Years,” Department of Energy 4“Gas-electric hybrid vehicles get a boost in the US from Ford, other,” Reuters 5“Stellantis sees long road ahead for internal combustion engine cars,” Reuters 6Global Cyber Security 2023 Study, CMS 7Buying Outlook, Capital One 8“Autoworkers’ Strike Could Affect New Car Prices,” Consumer Reports 9“Average car price is at an all-time high of $47,000 going into 2022,” The Zebra Letter to the Editor Send us a letter Have an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor, and we may publish it in print.

November 08, 2023 09:00 AM Tweet Share Share Email More   Tony Wanderon Over the past three years, the automotive industry has undergone significant changes, spurred by a global pandemic that disrupted vehicle supply chains, the rapid development of new technologies, and fluctuating interest rates. As manufacturers and dealerships have navigated this tumultuous landscape, they’ve been forced to adapt swiftly to the world’s ever-evolving demands. As we near the end of 2023, it’s crucial to look ahead and anticipate what 2024 might bring. With the rise of electric vehicle (EV) sales, inflation, and potential roadblocks stemming from strikes and parts shortages, the industry must stay vigilant and responsive to various market conditions and trends. EVs and Hybrid The shift towards electrification looks to have some headwinds in 2024. In 2023, EVs have been gaining momentum with a strong first half, up by 55% compared to the same period in the previous year.1 Today, four out of ten Americans are seriously considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase.2 However, higher than anticipated upfront costs, home charging, and the availability of free or for fee charging stations prove to bring some challenges to consumers today and into 2024. Even with growing an expanding network of charging stations, which alleviates some range anxiety.3  Interestingly, hybrids seem to be making inroads and are becoming an alternative of choice for OEMs and consumers.4 But the death of internal combustion (IC) vehicles seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as they will still be on the road for years to come.5  Emerging Technology Vehicles are evolving from mere means of transportation to fully connected devices. This transformation is prompting a shift in the overall vehicle experience, as manufacturers increasingly incorporate comprehensive software suites to facilitate integration with other smart devices. This digital shift is fostering personalized user experiences, enabling over-the-air updates, and leading to the development of more sophisticated infotainment systems. However, as vehicles become more connected, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks rises. Vehicle cyberthreats remain a significant concern for consumer cybersecurity6, necessitating that dealers offer robust training and comprehensive protection solutions to safeguard customers. The demand for personalized experiences extends to the car-buying process as well. In the post-pandemic era, there has been a noticeable shift towards digital tools in automotive retail. Today, 59% of car buyers prefer using digital tools provided by dealerships7, which facilitate various aspects of the buying process, including financing options, vehicle browsing, and educational resources to aid decision-making. Supply Chain Disruptions The pandemic unleashed widespread supply chain disruptions, from which the automotive industry is still recovering. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and ongoing semiconductor chip shortage brought more headwinds, resulting in a volatile market. Supply chain disruptions have broad-reaching implications, affecting dealerships and consumers alike. They lead to inventory shortages and drive-up vehicle prices.8 Between 2020 and 2021, the price of new cars surged by 17.2%.9 While vehicle prices are beginning to stabilize as inventory levels recover, dealerships must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to potential operational changes. The Takeaway While data and trends can provide insights into what 2024 may hold, it is impossible to predict the future with certainty. The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes driven by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, market demands, interest rates and global events. The past has shown that the world can change in an instant, underscoring the importance of resilience and staying well-informed as the automotive industry navigates the uncertainties of the coming year. 1Global EV Outlook, IEA 2“How Americans view electric vehicles,” Pew Research 3“The Number of Electric Vehicle Charging Ports in the U.S. Nearly Doubled in the Past Three Years,” Department of Energy 4“Gas-electric hybrid vehicles get a boost in the US from Ford, other,” Reuters 5“Stellantis sees long road ahead for internal combustion engine cars,” Reuters 6Global Cyber Security 2023 Study, CMS 7Buying Outlook, Capital One 8“Autoworkers’ Strike Could Affect New Car Prices,” Consumer Reports 9“Average car price is at an all-time high of $47,000 going into 2022,” The Zebra Letter to the Editor Send us a letter Have an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor, and we may publish it in print.

Last year, we saw the auto sector grapple with challenges like declining EV sales, widespread strikes in the U.S. factories, supply chain disruptions, and rising material costs. However, amidst these turbulent times, there were glimmers of hope and resilience. We saw car and commercial vehicle sales combined top 90mn with an astonishing double digit growth rate. India surged ahead to become the fourth-largest auto market for light vehicles. As 2024 begins, I am keen to share my team in Marketsandmarket’s insights and forecasts for an industry on the cusp of transformative changes, with significant advancements in connectivity, electrification, and sustainability. It’s a transformative time for the industry, and I’m excited to be part of this journey. While we wait for 2024 to unfold, let’s explore the key trends shaping this year's global automotive market. Electric Vehicles: A Slowdown, Not a Stall Though experiencing a slowdown, EV sales are still projected to rise in 2024. In the U.S., EV sales in 2024 are expected to grow y-o-y by merely 16% compared to ~64% in 2023. In China, y-o-y growth in 2024 would be 11.1% compared to 36.5% in 2023. Factors like reduced incentives, limited charging infrastructure, and the saturation of early adopters are significant hurdles. To attract the mass market, industry leaders like Musk are lowering prices, which I think is a move in the right direction. However, this slowdown is prompting major players like GM, VW, and Ford to adjust their strategies, with some lowering prices and delaying new models. Global EV sales slowing downMarkets and Markets, Statista, Others PROMOTED China’s Continued Dominance in the EV Market, globally not locally Amidst the sleek lines of cutting-edge EVs, China stands tall as a market giant and a global influencer, contributing 60% to worldwide EV sales. Its controlled supply chain, relentless innovation, and growing global presence solidify its leadership. By 2025, China is expected to capture 12% of the European EV market, fueled by competitive pricing, cutting-edge battery technology, and the growing popularity of Chinese electric car brands in the U.K. and other European and Asian markets. In 2024, China will firmly establish itself as a powerhouse in the EV revolution both in the home market and globally.

In the last couple of years, we saw a significant shift with SUVs becoming the ultimate uber luxury car of choice for the mega-rich, influencing brands like Aston Martin and Lamborghini. EVs are increasingly part of the luxury segment, expected to account for 15-17% of sales by 2024. With its growing affluent population, China is driving this luxury market transformation. 1/1             Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE PLAY Forbes Innovation 01:12 Video Settings Full Screen About Connatix V432044 What Is That New Machine Your Eye Doctor Is Using And Why: Electroretinography Plugging In for the Future: The EV Charging Revolution Expect a significant increase in charging stations in 2024, reaching around 2 million globally. Governments and OEMs are investing heavily in infrastructure, with DC fast-charging and ultra-fast charging leading the way. China is a significant player, with its fast-charging technologies expected to triple by 2024. E-Forecourts and depot charging solutions will also see significant growth. The number of chargers for new electric commercial vehicles is expected to touch 347K units in 2024 and growing to 1.14mn by 2030, with a majority of the increase contributed by DC chargers. Fast and ultra-fast chargers in depot settings for electric commercial vehicles are expected to grow at a CAGR of ~35% between 2023 and 2030. The Used Car Market Takes Center Stage The global used car market is experiencing significant growth, especially in APAC. In 2023, it saw a 3-4% increase, with sales of 94-96 million vehicles, and is projected to grow by 5-6% in 2024. The B2C segment is becoming more dominant, and it is expected to exceed 50% market share in APAC and North America, indicating a shift towards a more organized market. Despite mixed results in recent IPOs from companies like Vroom, Auto1, Cazoo, CarTrade, and Carvana, the market is set for transformation. The rise of online used car sellers and aggregators, such as Droom in India, is disrupting the industry, pointing to a future shaped by innovation, customer trust, and convenience. 5G Takes the Wheel: The Connected Car & Living Revolution This isn’t just a faster internet; I would call it a revolution on wheels. The 5G technology is set to transform the automotive industry, with major players like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, GM, Ford, Skoda, and Geely adopting it in their smart factories to improve automation, safety, and efficiency. This will only enhance in-car experiences with faster data transmission, low-latency communication, and improved navigation and infotainment systems. The automotive sector is expected to see a 30-35% annual growth rate in 5G adoption over the next few years. 5G will also facilitate what we term as “car as a connected living solution”, whereby the car in future will become an element of our connected home, connected workplace, connected energy, connected city and more, providing an integrated and seamless experience which will allow OEMs to generate addional revenues during the vehicle life-cycle. Generative AI: Shaping the Future of Cars Generative AI is transforming the automotive sector, impacting vehicle design, navigation, predictive maintenance, voice assistants, manufacturing, supply chain, and quality control. It will enhance the safety, efficiency, and personalization of in-car interactions. Major automotive companies are increasingly adopting this technology—Toyota and BMW for vehicle design, Tesla in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Continental in digital cockpits, and Mercedes Benz in Personal Voice Assistants. This marks a shift towards more intelligent and responsive automotive technologies. Gearing Up for the Future: Other Trends to Watch in 2024 Smart manufacturing, gigacasting, digital twins, and the impending impact of Euro-7 norms are poised to shape the industry in 2024, bringing about efficiencies and redefining operational strategies.

Last year, we saw the auto sector grapple with challenges like declining EV sales, widespread strikes in the U.S. factories, supply chain disruptions, and rising material costs. However, amidst these turbulent times, there were glimmers of hope and resilience. We saw car and commercial vehicle sales combined top 90mn with an astonishing double digit growth rate. India surged ahead to become the fourth-largest auto market for light vehicles. As 2024 begins, I am keen to share my team in Marketsandmarket’s insights and forecasts for an industry on the cusp of transformative changes, with significant advancements in connectivity, electrification, and sustainability. It’s a transformative time for the industry, and I’m excited to be part of this journey. While we wait for 2024 to unfold, let’s explore the key trends shaping this year's global automotive market. Electric Vehicles: A Slowdown, Not a Stall Though experiencing a slowdown, EV sales are still projected to rise in 2024. In the U.S., EV sales in 2024 are expected to grow y-o-y by merely 16% compared to ~64% in 2023. In China, y-o-y growth in 2024 would be 11.1% compared to 36.5% in 2023. Factors like reduced incentives, limited charging infrastructure, and the saturation of early adopters are significant hurdles. To attract the mass market, industry leaders like Musk are lowering prices, which I think is a move in the right direction. However, this slowdown is prompting major players like GM, VW, and Ford to adjust their strategies, with some lowering prices and delaying new models. Global EV sales slowing downMarkets and Markets, Statista, Others PROMOTED China’s Continued Dominance in the EV Market, globally not locally Amidst the sleek lines of cutting-edge EVs, China stands tall as a market giant and a global influencer, contributing 60% to worldwide EV sales. Its controlled supply chain, relentless innovation, and growing global presence solidify its leadership. By 2025, China is expected to capture 12% of the European EV market, fueled by competitive pricing, cutting-edge battery technology, and the growing popularity of Chinese electric car brands in the U.K. and other European and Asian markets. In 2024, China will firmly establish itself as a powerhouse in the EV revolution both in the home market and globally.

In the last couple of years, we saw a significant shift with SUVs becoming the ultimate uber luxury car of choice for the mega-rich, influencing brands like Aston Martin and Lamborghini. EVs are increasingly part of the luxury segment, expected to account for 15-17% of sales by 2024. With its growing affluent population, China is driving this luxury market transformation. 1/1             Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE PLAY Forbes Innovation 01:12 Video Settings Full Screen About Connatix V432044 What Is That New Machine Your Eye Doctor Is Using And Why: Electroretinography Plugging In for the Future: The EV Charging Revolution Expect a significant increase in charging stations in 2024, reaching around 2 million globally. Governments and OEMs are investing heavily in infrastructure, with DC fast-charging and ultra-fast charging leading the way. China is a significant player, with its fast-charging technologies expected to triple by 2024. E-Forecourts and depot charging solutions will also see significant growth. The number of chargers for new electric commercial vehicles is expected to touch 347K units in 2024 and growing to 1.14mn by 2030, with a majority of the increase contributed by DC chargers. Fast and ultra-fast chargers in depot settings for electric commercial vehicles are expected to grow at a CAGR of ~35% between 2023 and 2030. The Used Car Market Takes Center Stage The global used car market is experiencing significant growth, especially in APAC. In 2023, it saw a 3-4% increase, with sales of 94-96 million vehicles, and is projected to grow by 5-6% in 2024. The B2C segment is becoming more dominant, and it is expected to exceed 50% market share in APAC and North America, indicating a shift towards a more organized market. Despite mixed results in recent IPOs from companies like Vroom, Auto1, Cazoo, CarTrade, and Carvana, the market is set for transformation. The rise of online used car sellers and aggregators, such as Droom in India, is disrupting the industry, pointing to a future shaped by innovation, customer trust, and convenience. 5G Takes the Wheel: The Connected Car & Living Revolution This isn’t just a faster internet; I would call it a revolution on wheels. The 5G technology is set to transform the automotive industry, with major players like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, GM, Ford, Skoda, and Geely adopting it in their smart factories to improve automation, safety, and efficiency. This will only enhance in-car experiences with faster data transmission, low-latency communication, and improved navigation and infotainment systems. The automotive sector is expected to see a 30-35% annual growth rate in 5G adoption over the next few years. 5G will also facilitate what we term as “car as a connected living solution”, whereby the car in future will become an element of our connected home, connected workplace, connected energy, connected city and more, providing an integrated and seamless experience which will allow OEMs to generate addional revenues during the vehicle life-cycle. Generative AI: Shaping the Future of Cars Generative AI is transforming the automotive sector, impacting vehicle design, navigation, predictive maintenance, voice assistants, manufacturing, supply chain, and quality control. It will enhance the safety, efficiency, and personalization of in-car interactions. Major automotive companies are increasingly adopting this technology—Toyota and BMW for vehicle design, Tesla in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Continental in digital cockpits, and Mercedes Benz in Personal Voice Assistants. This marks a shift towards more intelligent and responsive automotive technologies. Gearing Up for the Future: Other Trends to Watch in 2024 Smart manufacturing, gigacasting, digital twins, and the impending impact of Euro-7 norms are poised to shape the industry in 2024, bringing about efficiencies and redefining operational strategies. Conclusion I anticipate a year filled with breakthroughs and transformative experiences, even as the industry, despite a slowdown in growth rates for 2024, is on track to hit a landmark 100 million units in sales, including both passenger and commercial vehicles, by 2026.

Explore key findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study, including the evolution of mobility, connectivity, car buying trends, and more. Save for later  Trends impacting the global mobility ecosystem From September through October 2023, we surveyed more than 27,000 consumers in 26 countries to explore opinions regarding a variety of critical issues impacting the automotive sector, including consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs), brand perceptions, and connected technology adoption. Our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study provides important insights that can help companies prioritize and better position their business strategies and investments in the year to come. In this year’s study, four key trends emerged: Slowing EV momentum may be putting current decarbonization timelines in jeopardy. A significant number of consumers may be thinking about switching vehicle brands. Interest in connectivity features may not fully translate into revenue and profit. Younger consumers are interested in vehicle subscriptions, as a growing number of them question if they need to own a vehicle going forward.  For more details on these evolving automotive consumer trends, download the full report.                         2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study                      Download the report Trend 1: Vehicle electrification High interest rates and elevated sticker prices may be causing consumer interest in EVs to soften in some markets. Despite automaker price cuts and government incentives designed to make them more affordable, a variety of other challenges continue to stand in the way, including range anxiety, charging time, and availability of charging infrastructure.   Trend 2: Future vehicle intentions Price tops the list of factors driving the choice of vehicle brand for consumers in developed markets, including Germany, Japan, and the United States; while vehicle performance (China and South Korea) and product quality (India) are top of mind for consumers in other global markets.   Trend 3: Connectivity Among those who are interested in connected vehicles, there is a relatively high level of interest in features that provide updates on maintenance, traffic/road safety, and suggestions for safer routes. However, the willingness to pay extra for connected technologies remains comparatively low in developed markets.   Trend 4: Vehicle subscriptions Against the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions causing concern for financial capacity, a significant number of younger consumers in many markets are at least somewhat interested in giving up vehicle ownership altogether in favor of a subscription model, but concerns about vehicle availability, total ownership cost, and the perception of higher monthly fees persist.   Want more findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study?

Explore key findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study, including the evolution of mobility, connectivity, car buying trends, and more. Save for later  Trends impacting the global mobility ecosystem From September through October 2023, we surveyed more than 27,000 consumers in 26 countries to explore opinions regarding a variety of critical issues impacting the automotive sector, including consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs), brand perceptions, and connected technology adoption. Our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study provides important insights that can help companies prioritize and better position their business strategies and investments in the year to come. In this year’s study, four key trends emerged: Slowing EV momentum may be putting current decarbonization timelines in jeopardy. A significant number of consumers may be thinking about switching vehicle brands. Interest in connectivity features may not fully translate into revenue and profit. Younger consumers are interested in vehicle subscriptions, as a growing number of them question if they need to own a vehicle going forward.  For more details on these evolving automotive consumer trends, download the full report.                         2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study                      Download the report Trend 1: Vehicle electrification High interest rates and elevated sticker prices may be causing consumer interest in EVs to soften in some markets. Despite automaker price cuts and government incentives designed to make them more affordable, a variety of other challenges continue to stand in the way, including range anxiety, charging time, and availability of charging infrastructure.   Trend 2: Future vehicle intentions Price tops the list of factors driving the choice of vehicle brand for consumers in developed markets, including Germany, Japan, and the United States; while vehicle performance (China and South Korea) and product quality (India) are top of mind for consumers in other global markets.   Trend 3: Connectivity Among those who are interested in connected vehicles, there is a relatively high level of interest in features that provide updates on maintenance, traffic/road safety, and suggestions for safer routes. However, the willingness to pay extra for connected technologies remains comparatively low in developed markets.   Trend 4: Vehicle subscriptions Against the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions causing concern for financial capacity, a significant number of younger consumers in many markets are at least somewhat interested in giving up vehicle ownership altogether in favor of a subscription model, but concerns about vehicle availability, total ownership cost, and the perception of higher monthly fees persist.   Want more findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study?

Explore key findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study, including the evolution of mobility, connectivity, car buying trends, and more. Save for later  Trends impacting the global mobility ecosystem From September through October 2023, we surveyed more than 27,000 consumers in 26 countries to explore opinions regarding a variety of critical issues impacting the automotive sector, including consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs), brand perceptions, and connected technology adoption. Our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study provides important insights that can help companies prioritize and better position their business strategies and investments in the year to come. In this year’s study, four key trends emerged: Slowing EV momentum may be putting current decarbonization timelines in jeopardy. A significant number of consumers may be thinking about switching vehicle brands. Interest in connectivity features may not fully translate into revenue and profit. Younger consumers are interested in vehicle subscriptions, as a growing number of them question if they need to own a vehicle going forward.  For more details on these evolving automotive consumer trends, download the full report.                         2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study                      Download the report Trend 1: Vehicle electrification High interest rates and elevated sticker prices may be causing consumer interest in EVs to soften in some markets. Despite automaker price cuts and government incentives designed to make them more affordable, a variety of other challenges continue to stand in the way, including range anxiety, charging time, and availability of charging infrastructure.   Trend 2: Future vehicle intentions Price tops the list of factors driving the choice of vehicle brand for consumers in developed markets, including Germany, Japan, and the United States; while vehicle performance (China and South Korea) and product quality (India) are top of mind for consumers in other global markets.   Trend 3: Connectivity Among those who are interested in connected vehicles, there is a relatively high level of interest in features that provide updates on maintenance, traffic/road safety, and suggestions for safer routes. However, the willingness to pay extra for connected technologies remains comparatively low in developed markets.   Trend 4: Vehicle subscriptions Against the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions causing concern for financial capacity, a significant number of younger consumers in many markets are at least somewhat interested in giving up vehicle ownership altogether in favor of a subscription model, but concerns about vehicle availability, total ownership cost, and the perception of higher monthly fees persist.   Want more findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study?

COVID-19 Impact: Pandemic Hampered the Demand for Market The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with Auto parts market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden rise in CAGR is attributable to the market's growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over.  Many auto parts manufacturers faced disruptions in their supply chains due to factory shutdowns, restrictions on movement, and reduced workforce during the pandemic. This led to delays in production and delivery of auto part, causing a shortage in the market. The pandemic caused a decline in vehicle sales as economic uncertainty, lockdown measures, and reduced consumer spending affected the automotive industry. With fewer cars being produced and sold, the demand for market also decreased. The pandemic resulted in a shift in consumer behaviour, with people reducing their travel and commuting. As a result, the demand for certain parts like tires, brakes, and suspension components decreased, while the demand for maintenance and repair parts increased as people focused on keeping their existing vehicles in good condition. The economic impact of the pandemic led to financial challenges for many parts suppliers. Reduced sales and disrupted operations put financial strain on companies, leading to layoffs, bankruptcies, or closures in some cases.

Explore key findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study, including the evolution of mobility, connectivity, car buying trends, and more. print Share  2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study 12 MB PDF 1 / 1 Trends impacting the global mobility ecosystem   From September through October 2023, we surveyed more than 27,000 consumers in 26 countries to explore opinions regarding a variety of critical issues impacting the automotive sector, including consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs), brand perceptions, and connected technology adoption. Our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study provides important insights that can help companies prioritize and better position their business strategies and investments in the year to come. In this year’s study, four key trends emerged: Slowing EV momentum may be putting current decarbonization timelines in jeopardy. A significant number of consumers may be thinking about switching vehicle brands. Interest in connectivity features may not fully translate into revenue and profit.  Younger consumers are interested in vehicle subscriptions, as a growing number of them question if they need to own a vehicle going forward.  For more details on these evolving automotive consumer trends, download the full report. Trend 1: Vehicle electrification   High interest rates and elevated sticker prices may be causing consumer interest in EVs to soften in some markets. Despite automaker price cuts and government incentives designed to make them more affordable, a variety of other challenges continue to stand in the way, including range anxiety, charging time, and availability of charging infrastructure. Consumer interest in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) vehicles is rebounding in some markets surveyed as affordability concerns continue to weigh heavily on forward intentions. Share Trend 2: Future vehicle intentions   Price tops the list of factors driving the choice of vehicle brand for consumers in developed markets, including Germany, Japan, and the United States; while vehicle performance (China and South Korea) and product quality (India) are top of mind for consumers in other global markets. Depending on the market, what matters most to consumers surveyed as they think about their next vehicle brand is either price, product quality, or performance. Share Trend 3: Connectivity   Among those who are interested in connected vehicles, there is a relatively high level of interest in features that provide updates on maintenance, traffic/road safety, and suggestions for safer routes. However, the willingness to pay extra for connected technologies remains comparatively low in developed markets. Consumers surveyed in developing markets such as India, China, and Southeast Asia are also more willing to pay for connected vehicle services compared to consumers surveyed in markets such as the United States, Japan, and Germany.  India: 71% China: 60% Southeast Asia: 55% Rep. of Korea: 33% US: 25% Japan: 23% Germany: 20% Trend 4: Vehicle subscriptions    Against the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions causing concern for financial capacity, a significant number of younger consumers in many markets are at least somewhat interested in giving up vehicle ownership altogether in favor of a subscription model, but concerns about vehicle availability, total ownership cost, and the perception of higher monthly fees persist. Consumer interest in giving up vehicle ownership in favor of vehicle subscription (% very/somewhat interested) for 18- to 34-year-old respondents: Share Want more findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study?   Sign up to receive more information about the biggest consumer trends driving the auto industry.

Explore key findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study, including the evolution of mobility, connectivity, car buying trends, and more. print Share  2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study 12 MB PDF 1 / 1 Trends impacting the global mobility ecosystem   From September through October 2023, we surveyed more than 27,000 consumers in 26 countries to explore opinions regarding a variety of critical issues impacting the automotive sector, including consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs), brand perceptions, and connected technology adoption. Our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study provides important insights that can help companies prioritize and better position their business strategies and investments in the year to come. In this year’s study, four key trends emerged: Slowing EV momentum may be putting current decarbonization timelines in jeopardy. A significant number of consumers may be thinking about switching vehicle brands. Interest in connectivity features may not fully translate into revenue and profit.  Younger consumers are interested in vehicle subscriptions, as a growing number of them question if they need to own a vehicle going forward.  For more details on these evolving automotive consumer trends, download the full report. Trend 1: Vehicle electrification   High interest rates and elevated sticker prices may be causing consumer interest in EVs to soften in some markets. Despite automaker price cuts and government incentives designed to make them more affordable, a variety of other challenges continue to stand in the way, including range anxiety, charging time, and availability of charging infrastructure. Consumer interest in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) vehicles is rebounding in some markets surveyed as affordability concerns continue to weigh heavily on forward intentions. Share Trend 2: Future vehicle intentions   Price tops the list of factors driving the choice of vehicle brand for consumers in developed markets, including Germany, Japan, and the United States; while vehicle performance (China and South Korea) and product quality (India) are top of mind for consumers in other global markets. Depending on the market, what matters most to consumers surveyed as they think about their next vehicle brand is either price, product quality, or performance. Share Trend 3: Connectivity   Among those who are interested in connected vehicles, there is a relatively high level of interest in features that provide updates on maintenance, traffic/road safety, and suggestions for safer routes. However, the willingness to pay extra for connected technologies remains comparatively low in developed markets. Consumers surveyed in developing markets such as India, China, and Southeast Asia are also more willing to pay for connected vehicle services compared to consumers surveyed in markets such as the United States, Japan, and Germany.  India: 71% China: 60% Southeast Asia: 55% Rep. of Korea: 33% US: 25% Japan: 23% Germany: 20% Trend 4: Vehicle subscriptions    Against the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions causing concern for financial capacity, a significant number of younger consumers in many markets are at least somewhat interested in giving up vehicle ownership altogether in favor of a subscription model, but concerns about vehicle availability, total ownership cost, and the perception of higher monthly fees persist. Consumer interest in giving up vehicle ownership in favor of vehicle subscription (% very/somewhat interested) for 18- to 34-year-old respondents: Share Want more findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study?   Sign up to receive more information about the biggest consumer trends driving the auto industry.

Explore key findings from our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study, including the evolution of mobility, connectivity, car buying trends, and more. print Share  2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study 12 MB PDF 1 / 1 Trends impacting the global mobility ecosystem   From September through October 2023, we surveyed more than 27,000 consumers in 26 countries to explore opinions regarding a variety of critical issues impacting the automotive sector, including consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs), brand perceptions, and connected technology adoption. Our 2024 Global Automotive Consumer Study provides important insights that can help companies prioritize and better position their business strategies and investments in the year to come. In this year’s study, four key trends emerged: Slowing EV momentum may be putting current decarbonization timelines in jeopardy. A significant number of consumers may be thinking about switching vehicle brands. Interest in connectivity features may not fully translate into revenue and profit.  Younger consumers are interested in vehicle subscriptions, as a growing number of them question if they need to own a vehicle going forward.  For more details on these evolving automotive consumer trends, download the full report.

Here’s the latest…If you’re in the market for a car this year it won’t be quite as daunting as it was during the pandemic and its immediate aftermath. Inventories are up and price increases are slowing. Here’s what to expect for the auto industry in 2024:1. Sales of new cars should hit 15.7 million, up from 2023. Vehicle availability has steadily improved after years of shortages, so more shoppers should find a ride to suit them. Price increases are slowing down. Buyers should have more room to haggle. They may even see some sales incentives, which all but disappeared during the COVID-19 era. Deals won’t exactly be juicy. But some price breaks and low-interest, or even zero-interest, financing could be back on the table. A few years ago, asking for such concessions would have been unthinkable.  Free Issue Save up to 74% on Kiplinger Personal Finance Become a smarter, better informed investor.

Used autos are about 40% more expensive than comparable ones from before the pandemic, as supplies remain tight.RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...kiplinger3. Hybrid vehicles are the hot sellers this year. Look for their market share to rise from 9% last year to 14%. Most consumers aren’t yet sold on electric cars. Hybrids offer fuel savings at a modest price premium and generally drive like traditional cars. Note how common hybrids are becoming. Once reserved for economy cars, hybrid tech is now available in just about every class of vehicle, from family sedans, minivans, full-size pickup trucks, and small trucks to every size of sport-utility vehicle. Toyota’s venerable Camry will become hybrid-only, starting with the 2025 model year. Its newly redesigned Prius gets rave reviews and almost 60 miles per gallon. Ford has a hit on its hands with the small but practical Maverick hybrid pickup truck. 4. Sales of EVs will grow, but their momentum is waning. Look for EV models to account for 9% of total vehicle sales this year, vs. 8% in 2023. Manufacturers are slowing future EV production plans as inventories build up on dealer lots. Dealers recently had 113 days’ worth of supply of EVs at the current sales pace, about double the level for gas-fueled cars. If you’re interested in an electric car, you’ll have more room to negotiate. Also, note that the federal tax credit for EVs has become more generous. The $7,500 is now available at the time of purchase from the dealer, instead of as a credit filed with your taxes. However, fewer electric cars are eligible for the credit now, because they don’t meet the made-in-America requirements. While carmakers are pumping the brakes on EVs, they aren’t giving up. 37 new models are coming out this year, with a similar tally due in 2025. Government fuel efficiency rules make this a necessity. And automakers are hoping that car buyers, who are traditionally brand-loyal, will switch to their new EV options.This forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what’s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

Here’s the latest…If you’re in the market for a car this year it won’t be quite as daunting as it was during the pandemic and its immediate aftermath. Inventories are up and price increases are slowing. Here’s what to expect for the auto industry in 2024:1. Sales of new cars should hit 15.7 million, up from 2023. Vehicle availability has steadily improved after years of shortages, so more shoppers should find a ride to suit them. Price increases are slowing down. Buyers should have more room to haggle. They may even see some sales incentives, which all but disappeared during the COVID-19 era. Deals won’t exactly be juicy. But some price breaks and low-interest, or even zero-interest, financing could be back on the table. A few years ago, asking for such concessions would have been unthinkable.  Free Issue Save up to 74% on Kiplinger Personal Finance Become a smarter, better informed investor.

Used autos are about 40% more expensive than comparable ones from before the pandemic, as supplies remain tight.RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...kiplinger3. Hybrid vehicles are the hot sellers this year. Look for their market share to rise from 9% last year to 14%. Most consumers aren’t yet sold on electric cars. Hybrids offer fuel savings at a modest price premium and generally drive like traditional cars. Note how common hybrids are becoming. Once reserved for economy cars, hybrid tech is now available in just about every class of vehicle, from family sedans, minivans, full-size pickup trucks, and small trucks to every size of sport-utility vehicle. Toyota’s venerable Camry will become hybrid-only, starting with the 2025 model year. Its newly redesigned Prius gets rave reviews and almost 60 miles per gallon. Ford has a hit on its hands with the small but practical Maverick hybrid pickup truck. 4. Sales of EVs will grow, but their momentum is waning. Look for EV models to account for 9% of total vehicle sales this year, vs. 8% in 2023. Manufacturers are slowing future EV production plans as inventories build up on dealer lots. Dealers recently had 113 days’ worth of supply of EVs at the current sales pace, about double the level for gas-fueled cars. If you’re interested in an electric car, you’ll have more room to negotiate. Also, note that the federal tax credit for EVs has become more generous. The $7,500 is now available at the time of purchase from the dealer, instead of as a credit filed with your taxes. However, fewer electric cars are eligible for the credit now, because they don’t meet the made-in-America requirements. While carmakers are pumping the brakes on EVs, they aren’t giving up. 37 new models are coming out this year, with a similar tally due in 2025. Government fuel efficiency rules make this a necessity. And automakers are hoping that car buyers, who are traditionally brand-loyal, will switch to their new EV options.This forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what’s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

COVID-19 Impact: Pandemic Hampered the Demand for Market The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with Auto parts market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden rise in CAGR is attributable to the market's growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over.  Many auto parts manufacturers faced disruptions in their supply chains due to factory shutdowns, restrictions on movement, and reduced workforce during the pandemic. This led to delays in production and delivery of auto part, causing a shortage in the market. The pandemic caused a decline in vehicle sales as economic uncertainty, lockdown measures, and reduced consumer spending affected the automotive industry. With fewer cars being produced and sold, the demand for market also decreased. The pandemic resulted in a shift in consumer behaviour, with people reducing their travel and commuting. As a result, the demand for certain parts like tires, brakes, and suspension components decreased, while the demand for maintenance and repair parts increased as people focused on keeping their existing vehicles in good condition. The economic impact of the pandemic led to financial challenges for many parts suppliers. Reduced sales and disrupted operations put financial strain on companies, leading to layoffs, bankruptcies, or closures in some cases.

COVID-19 Impact: Pandemic Hampered the Demand for Market The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with Auto parts market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden rise in CAGR is attributable to the market's growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over.  Many auto parts manufacturers faced disruptions in their supply chains due to factory shutdowns, restrictions on movement, and reduced workforce during the pandemic. This led to delays in production and delivery of auto part, causing a shortage in the market. The pandemic caused a decline in vehicle sales as economic uncertainty, lockdown measures, and reduced consumer spending affected the automotive industry. With fewer cars being produced and sold, the demand for market also decreased. The pandemic resulted in a shift in consumer behaviour, with people reducing their travel and commuting. As a result, the demand for certain parts like tires, brakes, and suspension components decreased, while the demand for maintenance and repair parts increased as people focused on keeping their existing vehicles in good condition. The economic impact of the pandemic led to financial challenges for many parts suppliers. Reduced sales and disrupted operations put financial strain on companies, leading to layoffs, bankruptcies, or closures in some cases.

November 08, 2023 09:00 AM Tweet Share Share Email More   Tony Wanderon Over the past three years, the automotive industry has undergone significant changes, spurred by a global pandemic that disrupted vehicle supply chains, the rapid development of new technologies, and fluctuating interest rates. As manufacturers and dealerships have navigated this tumultuous landscape, they’ve been forced to adapt swiftly to the world’s ever-evolving demands. As we near the end of 2023, it’s crucial to look ahead and anticipate what 2024 might bring. With the rise of electric vehicle (EV) sales, inflation, and potential roadblocks stemming from strikes and parts shortages, the industry must stay vigilant and responsive to various market conditions and trends. EVs and Hybrid The shift towards electrification looks to have some headwinds in 2024. In 2023, EVs have been gaining momentum with a strong first half, up by 55% compared to the same period in the previous year.1 Today, four out of ten Americans are seriously considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase.2 However, higher than anticipated upfront costs, home charging, and the availability of free or for fee charging stations prove to bring some challenges to consumers today and into 2024. Even with growing an expanding network of charging stations, which alleviates some range anxiety.3  Interestingly, hybrids seem to be making inroads and are becoming an alternative of choice for OEMs and consumers.4 But the death of internal combustion (IC) vehicles seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as they will still be on the road for years to come.5  Emerging Technology Vehicles are evolving from mere means of transportation to fully connected devices. This transformation is prompting a shift in the overall vehicle experience, as manufacturers increasingly incorporate comprehensive software suites to facilitate integration with other smart devices. This digital shift is fostering personalized user experiences, enabling over-the-air updates, and leading to the development of more sophisticated infotainment systems. However, as vehicles become more connected, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks rises. Vehicle cyberthreats remain a significant concern for consumer cybersecurity6, necessitating that dealers offer robust training and comprehensive protection solutions to safeguard customers. The demand for personalized experiences extends to the car-buying process as well. In the post-pandemic era, there has been a noticeable shift towards digital tools in automotive retail. Today, 59% of car buyers prefer using digital tools provided by dealerships7, which facilitate various aspects of the buying process, including financing options, vehicle browsing, and educational resources to aid decision-making. Supply Chain Disruptions The pandemic unleashed widespread supply chain disruptions, from which the automotive industry is still recovering. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and ongoing semiconductor chip shortage brought more headwinds, resulting in a volatile market. Supply chain disruptions have broad-reaching implications, affecting dealerships and consumers alike. They lead to inventory shortages and drive-up vehicle prices.8 Between 2020 and 2021, the price of new cars surged by 17.2%.9 While vehicle prices are beginning to stabilize as inventory levels recover, dealerships must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to potential operational changes. The Takeaway While data and trends can provide insights into what 2024 may hold, it is impossible to predict the future with certainty. The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes driven by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, market demands, interest rates and global events. The past has shown that the world can change in an instant, underscoring the importance of resilience and staying well-informed as the automotive industry navigates the uncertainties of the coming year. 1Global EV Outlook, IEA 2“How Americans view electric vehicles,” Pew Research 3“The Number of Electric Vehicle Charging Ports in the U.S. Nearly Doubled in the Past Three Years,” Department of Energy 4“Gas-electric hybrid vehicles get a boost in the US from Ford, other,” Reuters 5“Stellantis sees long road ahead for internal combustion engine cars,” Reuters 6Global Cyber Security 2023 Study, CMS 7Buying Outlook, Capital One 8“Autoworkers’ Strike Could Affect New Car Prices,” Consumer Reports 9“Average car price is at an all-time high of $47,000 going into 2022,” The Zebra Letter to the Editor Send us a letter Have an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor, and we may publish it in print.

Even with growing an expanding network of charging stations, which alleviates some range anxiety.3  Interestingly, hybrids seem to be making inroads and are becoming an alternative of choice for OEMs and consumers.4 But the death of internal combustion (IC) vehicles seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as they will still be on the road for years to come.5  Emerging Technology Vehicles are evolving from mere means of transportation to fully connected devices. This transformation is prompting a shift in the overall vehicle experience, as manufacturers increasingly incorporate comprehensive software suites to facilitate integration with other smart devices. This digital shift is fostering personalized user experiences, enabling over-the-air updates, and leading to the development of more sophisticated infotainment systems. However, as vehicles become more connected, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks rises. Vehicle cyberthreats remain a significant concern for consumer cybersecurity6, necessitating that dealers offer robust training and comprehensive protection solutions to safeguard customers. The demand for personalized experiences extends to the car-buying process as well. In the post-pandemic era, there has been a noticeable shift towards digital tools in automotive retail. Today, 59% of car buyers prefer using digital tools provided by dealerships7, which facilitate various aspects of the buying process, including financing options, vehicle browsing, and educational resources to aid decision-making. Supply Chain Disruptions The pandemic unleashed widespread supply chain disruptions, from which the automotive industry is still recovering. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and ongoing semiconductor chip shortage brought more headwinds, resulting in a volatile market. Supply chain disruptions have broad-reaching implications, affecting dealerships and consumers alike. They lead to inventory shortages and drive-up vehicle prices.8 Between 2020 and 2021, the price of new cars surged by 17.2%.9 While vehicle prices are beginning to stabilize as inventory levels recover, dealerships must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to potential operational changes. The Takeaway While data and trends can provide insights into what 2024 may hold, it is impossible to predict the future with certainty. The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes driven by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, market demands, interest rates and global events. The past has shown that the world can change in an instant, underscoring the importance of resilience and staying well-informed as the automotive industry navigates the uncertainties of the coming year. 1Global EV Outlook, IEA 2“How Americans view electric vehicles,” Pew Research 3“The Number of Electric Vehicle Charging Ports in the U.S. Nearly Doubled in the Past Three Years,” Department of Energy 4“Gas-electric hybrid vehicles get a boost in the US from Ford, other,” Reuters 5“Stellantis sees long road ahead for internal combustion engine cars,” Reuters 6Global Cyber Security 2023 Study, CMS 7Buying Outlook, Capital One 8“Autoworkers’ Strike Could Affect New Car Prices,” Consumer Reports 9“Average car price is at an all-time high of $47,000 going into 2022,” The Zebra Letter to the Editor Send us a letter Have an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor, and we may publish it in print.

November 08, 2023 09:00 AM Tweet Share Share Email More   Tony Wanderon Over the past three years, the automotive industry has undergone significant changes, spurred by a global pandemic that disrupted vehicle supply chains, the rapid development of new technologies, and fluctuating interest rates. As manufacturers and dealerships have navigated this tumultuous landscape, they’ve been forced to adapt swiftly to the world’s ever-evolving demands. As we near the end of 2023, it’s crucial to look ahead and anticipate what 2024 might bring. With the rise of electric vehicle (EV) sales, inflation, and potential roadblocks stemming from strikes and parts shortages, the industry must stay vigilant and responsive to various market conditions and trends. EVs and Hybrid The shift towards electrification looks to have some headwinds in 2024. In 2023, EVs have been gaining momentum with a strong first half, up by 55% compared to the same period in the previous year.1 Today, four out of ten Americans are seriously considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase.2 However, higher than anticipated upfront costs, home charging, and the availability of free or for fee charging stations prove to bring some challenges to consumers today and into 2024. Even with growing an expanding network of charging stations, which alleviates some range anxiety.3  Interestingly, hybrids seem to be making inroads and are becoming an alternative of choice for OEMs and consumers.4 But the death of internal combustion (IC) vehicles seems to have been greatly exaggerated, as they will still be on the road for years to come.5  Emerging Technology Vehicles are evolving from mere means of transportation to fully connected devices. This transformation is prompting a shift in the overall vehicle experience, as manufacturers increasingly incorporate comprehensive software suites to facilitate integration with other smart devices. This digital shift is fostering personalized user experiences, enabling over-the-air updates, and leading to the development of more sophisticated infotainment systems. However, as vehicles become more connected, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks rises. Vehicle cyberthreats remain a significant concern for consumer cybersecurity6, necessitating that dealers offer robust training and comprehensive protection solutions to safeguard customers. The demand for personalized experiences extends to the car-buying process as well. In the post-pandemic era, there has been a noticeable shift towards digital tools in automotive retail. Today, 59% of car buyers prefer using digital tools provided by dealerships7, which facilitate various aspects of the buying process, including financing options, vehicle browsing, and educational resources to aid decision-making. Supply Chain Disruptions The pandemic unleashed widespread supply chain disruptions, from which the automotive industry is still recovering. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and ongoing semiconductor chip shortage brought more headwinds, resulting in a volatile market. Supply chain disruptions have broad-reaching implications, affecting dealerships and consumers alike. They lead to inventory shortages and drive-up vehicle prices.8 Between 2020 and 2021, the price of new cars surged by 17.2%.9 While vehicle prices are beginning to stabilize as inventory levels recover, dealerships must remain vigilant and prepared to adapt to potential operational changes. The Takeaway While data and trends can provide insights into what 2024 may hold, it is impossible to predict the future with certainty. The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes driven by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, market demands, interest rates and global events.

Industry News What Lies Ahead for Auto Industry in 2024     Trends in 2024 will demonstrate the need for extended collaboration at all stages in the automotive development process.   Chris Clark | Dec 18, 2023 Save The race to develop the most advanced, secure and safe vehicles on the road has been on for quite some time, but we expect that race to gain speed in 2024. Global competition between automakers, consumer demand for advanced features, upcoming automotive industry regulations and new entrants to the automotive silicon market are fueling this fierce battle. Despite this competition and intensified market pressure, there is still a need for extended collaboration at all stages in the automotive development process to manage the increasing complexity of vehicle systems-on-chip (SoCs), the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape and shortening development cycles. Here are our top four predictions that we see guiding the automotive market in 2024: Market Pressure Yields Shorter Automotive Development Cycles Automakers are rushing to keep up with Chinese manufacturers who are setting the pace of development at levels previously unseen in the traditional market. Due to robust automotive safety standards and resulting testing needs, the technology in a brand-new  car is likely to be five to seven years old. Chinese manufacturers are closing that gap to be closer to three to five years. Both silicon and software testing validation need to happen quickly to accelerate development, often in parallel with one another. One way the industry is lessening the time to market for vehicles is by using digital twin technology, which can be utilized for an entire vehicle, its software, electrical system, SoCs, etc., to detect performance issues, test new features and optimize features throughout the entire design and manufacturing processes. Digital twins – virtual models or representations of a system under development – can also be used for vehicle electrical/electronic (E/E)-system validation, allowing for a shift-left approach in automotive design that is invaluable for shortening design and development cycles. That’s because it permits early hardware and software integration and frontload testing. Additionally, silicon lifecycle management technology, with data collected from in-vehicle sensors for analysis, can deliver insights that will support root-cause analysis, predictive maintenance, and aging and degradation management. Centralized Zonal Architecture Will Begin to Come Online  While zonal architectures for automotive won’t be fully rolled out until the end of this decade, we expect to see the development of zonal architectures that will further integrate functions and associated application software into centralized SoCs and modules. This mixture of new applications and evolving system architecture has enabled a new level of sensors and SoCs with high performance, expanded functionality, new hosted applications and amplified amounts of AI. Thus, this increasing level of complexity is forcing the industry to adopt leading-edge automotive semiconductor technologies at 7 nm, 5 nm and even 3 nm. Full realization of zonal architecture within the automotive industry will occur incrementally as certain OEMs, especially electric vehicle manufacturers such as Tesla, invest more aggressively in new platforms and applications and therefore move SoCs to more advanced nodes. In 2024, we also will see more hybrid architectures being used to achieve a centralized system by 2030. New Entrants to Automotive Silicon Design Call for Consulting Services Much like tech behemoths Meta, Apple and Amazon have brought chip development in-house, we are seeing a similar shift in the automotive industry. Both traditional automakers and those that are relatively new to the scene such as Rivian, BYD Auto and XPeng are getting into the chip design game, but they can’t do it alone. These companies will need their design engineering teams to ramp up productivity quickly. With today’s market pressures and distributed design teams, anything that brings greater efficiency could be turned into a competitive advantage. A common platform of chip design tools simplifies the effort and fosters better outcomes, eliminating the need to spend time making the tools work together. Beyond tools, additional expertise and consulting will be necessary for these companies, especially given the unique knowledge and technology required to develop automotive-grade products. There are simply not enough chip design engineers with automotive-grade expertise at each of these new-entrant automotive companies to round out an entire department without the use of consultants. UN Regulation 155 Will Increase Pressure for Cybersecurity Beginning July 2024, the UN 155 regulation on cybersecurity will require the entire automotive value chain from OEMs to suppliers and sub-suppliers to implement a cybersecurity management system. While the industry already can reference and utilize the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, which provides the framework to develop a secure product in the automotive industry, it is a standard, not a legal requirement. UN 155R is a legally binding regulation that automakers must follow to participate in the EU. In other words, the ISO 21434 industry standard provides support to meet requirements found in WP.29 regulation. This new standard applies to software, systems, components and IP, and will require further collaboration throughout the entire automotive supply chain. There are various ways to prepare now for UN 155, including implementing a Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) program, utilizing chip design and IP solutions developed with security in mind, using static analysis solutions to detect vulnerabilities early on, and implementing well-known encryption standards, to name a few. We will see some major changes in the automotive industry next year. The industry will need to come together to deliver on upcoming regulations, new features that the consumer has come to expect, and faster times to market. – with Ron DiGiuseppe and Stewart Williams Chris Clark (pictured, top left) is automotive systems security architect at Synopsys.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to access future capital, via dept or equity markets, or other sources; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 1, 2022, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   CANOO INC.

These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   CANOO INC.

These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   CANOO INC.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to access future capital, via dept or equity markets, or other sources; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 1, 2022, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.    ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.    ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.    ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.    ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.    ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.    ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,"" said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. ""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Learn More The electric vehicle maker's stock has collapsed. You need to know why before you jump aboard thinking you've found a bargain. Electric vehicles (EVs) are an increasingly important part of the future when it comes to global transportation trends. However, you wouldn't guess that by looking at the stock performance of Canoo (GOEV -3.16%). If you're an investor looking for bargain-basement stocks, this EV maker's low price might attract you to it. Here's five reasons you should tread carefully. 1. Canoo was not a normal IPO Canoo came public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in late 2020. While that may seem like a long time ago, it is important to put this transaction into context. At the time, SPACs were a hot investment topic and companies were coming public at a rapid clip via this route. SPACs aren't new, but they were not nearly as common before this period. Arrows-In  Collapse  NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Today's Change (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Arrow-Thin-Down  YTD1w1m3m6m1y         5y                         -98.57%                      Price             VS S&P            GOEV     Key Data Points Market Cap $157M Day's Range $0.14 - $0.15 52wk Range $0.14 - $0.90 Volume 365,975 Avg Vol 53,890,015 Gross Margin -3092.10% Dividend Yield N/A Basically, investors fund a SPAC via a more traditional initial public offering (IPO), seeding it with cash with the expectation that the SPAC will find an attractive private company to buy. With just a few SPACs around, the chances of success probably aren't all that bad. But with hundreds flooding the market, the batting average was bound to decline as SPACs had to move down the quality spectrum in order to find a company (any company) to buy. That's exactly what happened, and an increasing number of the SPAC mergers from that period are now resulting in bankruptcies.  Canoo's involvement in this little period of market exuberance is a good reason for investors to be extra cautious. Adding to this issue is that, at the time, the EV sector was also a hot topic among investors. In some ways, Canoo looks like Wall Street trying to cash in on two investment fads at one time. 2. Canoo has yet to make a profit One of the problems with a rush to take private companies public is that they may not be ready because their businesses aren't mature enough. While it may seem like forever ago, at one point in Wall Street history companies preferred to wait until they were profitable before trying to sell shares to the public. That's not the case anymore, which materially increases the risk for investors. In the case of Canoo, over two years after the SPAC merger it has yet to turn a quarterly profit. GOEV EPS Diluted (Quarterly) data by YCharts Companies can't lose money forever. And if Canoo can't manage to get into the black sooner rather than later, its future could be shorter than you think. 3. Canoo isn't generating any revenue You actually need revenue to produce earnings. And Canoo's income statement is shockingly devoid of revenue. Basically, it is trying to build out its business. When it comes to building large, complex products like EVs, that can be an expensive and time-consuming effort. All of the costs, for things like technology and factories, have to be paid before there's any revenue. So don't expect any earnings here until the company actually generates revenue -- which won't happen until it has a product to sell. 4. Canoo is paying as it goes While management is happy to highlight the positive milestones it has reached as it looks to get its business off the ground, there's a very real balance sheet issue to consider. At the end of the second quarter Canoo had just $5 million in cash. It expects to spend between $70 million and $100 million on capital investments in the second half of the year. You don't have to be a mathematician to see that Canoo didn't have enough money to do that at the end of the second quarter.  GOEV Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts That is why Canoo raised $56.2 million through convertible and stock sales in August. The capital raise was necessary, but it will likely end up diluting current shareholders. That's not a great outcome if you own the stock. 5. Management has to be positive Very few companies are going to come out and tell you that the future is bleak. Far more common is that management acts as something of a corporate cheerleader, highlighting all of the good news and downplaying negatives. So you need to take most things management says about Canoo with a grain of salt. And yet there's one place where the company is legally bound to be as honest as possible. In the company's second-quarter 2023 10Q filing with the SEC it stated: Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations. Basically, management is telling investors that there is a very real chance it will have to go through a corporate restructuring if, for any reason, it can't keep raising cash from investors. This is one time when you should take the company's word as gospel. Maybe Canoo pulls it off Canoo is a high-risk investment even after the stock has collapsed 97% from when it was brought public. The list of negatives is quite substantial and the bright future management is painting is largely based on outcomes that are in no way certain to come to pass. If you are looking at this EV stock today, you need to be cautious. A lot has to go right if it is to survive the negatives in place today.

Basically, management is telling investors that there is a very real chance it will have to go through a corporate restructuring if, for any reason, it can't keep raising cash from investors. This is one time when you should take the company's word as gospel. Maybe Canoo pulls it off Canoo is a high-risk investment even after the stock has collapsed 97% from when it was brought public. The list of negatives is quite substantial and the bright future management is painting is largely based on outcomes that are in no way certain to come to pass. If you are looking at this EV stock today, you need to be cautious. A lot has to go right if it is to survive the negatives in place today.

Learn More The electric vehicle maker's stock has collapsed. You need to know why before you jump aboard thinking you've found a bargain. Electric vehicles (EVs) are an increasingly important part of the future when it comes to global transportation trends. However, you wouldn't guess that by looking at the stock performance of Canoo (GOEV -3.16%). If you're an investor looking for bargain-basement stocks, this EV maker's low price might attract you to it. Here's five reasons you should tread carefully. 1. Canoo was not a normal IPO Canoo came public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in late 2020. While that may seem like a long time ago, it is important to put this transaction into context. At the time, SPACs were a hot investment topic and companies were coming public at a rapid clip via this route. SPACs aren't new, but they were not nearly as common before this period. Arrows-In  Collapse  NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Today's Change (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Arrow-Thin-Down  YTD1w1m3m6m1y         5y                         -98.57%                      Price             VS S&P            GOEV     Key Data Points Market Cap $157M Day's Range $0.14 - $0.15 52wk Range $0.14 - $0.90 Volume 365,975 Avg Vol 53,890,015 Gross Margin -3092.10% Dividend Yield N/A Basically, investors fund a SPAC via a more traditional initial public offering (IPO), seeding it with cash with the expectation that the SPAC will find an attractive private company to buy. With just a few SPACs around, the chances of success probably aren't all that bad. But with hundreds flooding the market, the batting average was bound to decline as SPACs had to move down the quality spectrum in order to find a company (any company) to buy. That's exactly what happened, and an increasing number of the SPAC mergers from that period are now resulting in bankruptcies.  Canoo's involvement in this little period of market exuberance is a good reason for investors to be extra cautious. Adding to this issue is that, at the time, the EV sector was also a hot topic among investors. In some ways, Canoo looks like Wall Street trying to cash in on two investment fads at one time. 2. Canoo has yet to make a profit One of the problems with a rush to take private companies public is that they may not be ready because their businesses aren't mature enough. While it may seem like forever ago, at one point in Wall Street history companies preferred to wait until they were profitable before trying to sell shares to the public. That's not the case anymore, which materially increases the risk for investors. In the case of Canoo, over two years after the SPAC merger it has yet to turn a quarterly profit. GOEV EPS Diluted (Quarterly) data by YCharts Companies can't lose money forever. And if Canoo can't manage to get into the black sooner rather than later, its future could be shorter than you think. 3. Canoo isn't generating any revenue You actually need revenue to produce earnings. And Canoo's income statement is shockingly devoid of revenue. Basically, it is trying to build out its business. When it comes to building large, complex products like EVs, that can be an expensive and time-consuming effort. All of the costs, for things like technology and factories, have to be paid before there's any revenue. So don't expect any earnings here until the company actually generates revenue -- which won't happen until it has a product to sell. 4. Canoo is paying as it goes While management is happy to highlight the positive milestones it has reached as it looks to get its business off the ground, there's a very real balance sheet issue to consider. At the end of the second quarter Canoo had just $5 million in cash. It expects to spend between $70 million and $100 million on capital investments in the second half of the year. You don't have to be a mathematician to see that Canoo didn't have enough money to do that at the end of the second quarter.  GOEV Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts That is why Canoo raised $56.2 million through convertible and stock sales in August. The capital raise was necessary, but it will likely end up diluting current shareholders. That's not a great outcome if you own the stock. 5. Management has to be positive Very few companies are going to come out and tell you that the future is bleak. Far more common is that management acts as something of a corporate cheerleader, highlighting all of the good news and downplaying negatives. So you need to take most things management says about Canoo with a grain of salt. And yet there's one place where the company is legally bound to be as honest as possible. In the company's second-quarter 2023 10Q filing with the SEC it stated: Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations. Basically, management is telling investors that there is a very real chance it will have to go through a corporate restructuring if, for any reason, it can't keep raising cash from investors. This is one time when you should take the company's word as gospel. Maybe Canoo pulls it off Canoo is a high-risk investment even after the stock has collapsed 97% from when it was brought public. The list of negatives is quite substantial and the bright future management is painting is largely based on outcomes that are in no way certain to come to pass. If you are looking at this EV stock today, you need to be cautious. A lot has to go right if it is to survive the negatives in place today.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Is Canoo Stock a Buy? By Reuben Brewer – Dec 8, 2023 at 5:02PM Key Points Canoo is attempting to build an electric vehicle manufacturing business. It generated revenue for the first time in the third quarter. It is still recording large losses and diluting shareholders. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Market Cap $157M Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Upstart electric vehicle maker Canoo reached a major milestone, but just generating revenue doesn't make it a good investment. Canoo (GOEV -3.16%) has huge ambitions of becoming an electric vehicle manufacturer. So far, there's more ambition than business. In fairness, though, the company did achieve an important milestone in the third quarter. It generated revenue. Here's why that's not nearly enough to make this stock worth buying today. Canoo has put in a lot of work It isn't easy building a car company from scratch. It gets extra complicated when you add in that Canoo is looking to make electric vehicles, a newer technology than the combustion engines that power the vast majority of the world's cars and trucks. That the company is now staffing up a manufacturing facility in Oklahoma is a statement to what it has achieved. So, too, is the fact that it reported $519,000 in revenue in the third quarter. Image source: Getty Images. That's basically the first time the company has reported revenue, so it is a huge milestone. It means Canoo has actually managed to sell something of value. To date, money has just been going out the door to pay for building the business that management hoped would one day, you know, generate some revenue. While the top line of the earnings statement was a welcome surprise in the quarter, the rest of the news from the company remains touch and go at best. For example, as you move down the income statement, you see that far more money is going out than coming in. The cost of goods sold was $903,000, leading to a negative gross margin of $384,000. Then there's the cost of research and development and selling general and administrative expenses, which were $22 million and $25 million, respectively. The loss from operations was nearly $49 million. This does not appear to be a sustainable business as it stands today, which is why the 10Q includes a going concern warning. Going concern warnings are required when a company's management team believes there's a real risk it will be unable to fund the business over the next 12 months. Which brings the story here to the balance sheet. Arrows-In  Collapse  NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Today's Change (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Arrow-Thin-Down  YTD1w1m3m6m1y         5y                         -98.57%                      Price             VS S&P            GOEV     Key Data Points Market Cap $157M Day's Range $0.14 - $0.15 52wk Range $0.14 - $0.90 Volume 365,975 Avg Vol 53,890,015 Gross Margin -3092.10% Dividend Yield N/A More cash means more dilution The big picture here is that Canoo does not generate enough cash on its own to fund the business it is building. That isn't shocking, given the scale of what it is trying to create. But there are very real costs that must be paid, and the money has to come from somewhere. That somewhere has largely been the capital markets via debt and equity sales. The company has some debt, notably including convertibles, but the real story is the stock sales it has used. Every new share of Canoo stock issued dilutes existing shareholders. And the numbers are pretty shocking. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, the company had 355.4 million shares outstanding. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, that number had grown to 650.9 million, an 83% rise in just a single year. GOEV data by YCharts. The problem is even uglier when you consider that the stock price has plunged over the past two years. The lower the stock price goes the more shares it takes to raise the same amount of cash. And the company needs that cash to continue spending on the development of its manufacturing facilities and to fund its research and development efforts. With virtually no revenues, there's really no other way to get it. And it's also worth noting that the company ended the quarter with only around $8 million of cash. Canoo isn't going away yet But don't fear; the sale of preferred stocks and warrants that occurred after the quarter's end increases the cash balance to $53 million. The company will likely live for another quarter but at the expense of diluting its existing shareholders again. And it still doesn't make any money while generating only modest revenues compared to its expenses. For most investors, this is not a great investment choice because there is a very real risk (openly admitted by management) that it will be unable to stay afloat. Indeed, at this point, if Wall Street decided to stop providing cash to Canoo, its outlook would darken considerably. Even aggressive investors might want to wait until the company turns profitable before considering this stock. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Is Canoo Stock a Buy? By Reuben Brewer – Dec 8, 2023 at 5:02PM Key Points Canoo is attempting to build an electric vehicle manufacturing business. It generated revenue for the first time in the third quarter. It is still recording large losses and diluting shareholders. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Market Cap $157M Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Upstart electric vehicle maker Canoo reached a major milestone, but just generating revenue doesn't make it a good investment. Canoo (GOEV -3.16%) has huge ambitions of becoming an electric vehicle manufacturer. So far, there's more ambition than business. In fairness, though, the company did achieve an important milestone in the third quarter. It generated revenue. Here's why that's not nearly enough to make this stock worth buying today. Canoo has put in a lot of work It isn't easy building a car company from scratch. It gets extra complicated when you add in that Canoo is looking to make electric vehicles, a newer technology than the combustion engines that power the vast majority of the world's cars and trucks. That the company is now staffing up a manufacturing facility in Oklahoma is a statement to what it has achieved. So, too, is the fact that it reported $519,000 in revenue in the third quarter. Image source: Getty Images. That's basically the first time the company has reported revenue, so it is a huge milestone. It means Canoo has actually managed to sell something of value. To date, money has just been going out the door to pay for building the business that management hoped would one day, you know, generate some revenue. While the top line of the earnings statement was a welcome surprise in the quarter, the rest of the news from the company remains touch and go at best. For example, as you move down the income statement, you see that far more money is going out than coming in. The cost of goods sold was $903,000, leading to a negative gross margin of $384,000. Then there's the cost of research and development and selling general and administrative expenses, which were $22 million and $25 million, respectively. The loss from operations was nearly $49 million. This does not appear to be a sustainable business as it stands today, which is why the 10Q includes a going concern warning. Going concern warnings are required when a company's management team believes there's a real risk it will be unable to fund the business over the next 12 months. Which brings the story here to the balance sheet. Arrows-In  Collapse  NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Today's Change (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Arrow-Thin-Down  YTD1w1m3m6m1y         5y                         -98.57%                      Price             VS S&P            GOEV     Key Data Points Market Cap $157M Day's Range $0.14 - $0.15 52wk Range $0.14 - $0.90 Volume 365,975 Avg Vol 53,890,015 Gross Margin -3092.10% Dividend Yield N/A More cash means more dilution The big picture here is that Canoo does not generate enough cash on its own to fund the business it is building. That isn't shocking, given the scale of what it is trying to create. But there are very real costs that must be paid, and the money has to come from somewhere. That somewhere has largely been the capital markets via debt and equity sales. The company has some debt, notably including convertibles, but the real story is the stock sales it has used. Every new share of Canoo stock issued dilutes existing shareholders. And the numbers are pretty shocking. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, the company had 355.4 million shares outstanding. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, that number had grown to 650.9 million, an 83% rise in just a single year. GOEV data by YCharts. The problem is even uglier when you consider that the stock price has plunged over the past two years. The lower the stock price goes the more shares it takes to raise the same amount of cash. And the company needs that cash to continue spending on the development of its manufacturing facilities and to fund its research and development efforts. With virtually no revenues, there's really no other way to get it. And it's also worth noting that the company ended the quarter with only around $8 million of cash. Canoo isn't going away yet But don't fear; the sale of preferred stocks and warrants that occurred after the quarter's end increases the cash balance to $53 million. The company will likely live for another quarter but at the expense of diluting its existing shareholders again. And it still doesn't make any money while generating only modest revenues compared to its expenses. For most investors, this is not a great investment choice because there is a very real risk (openly admitted by management) that it will be unable to stay afloat. Indeed, at this point, if Wall Street decided to stop providing cash to Canoo, its outlook would darken considerably. Even aggressive investors might want to wait until the company turns profitable before considering this stock. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to access future capital, via dept or equity markets, or other sources; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 1, 2022, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to access future capital, via dept or equity markets, or other sources; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 1, 2022, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to access future capital, via dept or equity markets, or other sources; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 1, 2022, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.
